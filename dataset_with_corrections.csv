McIlroy carded a third straight five under-par 67 to move to 15 under par with Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat. The world number three's round included an eagle on the 12th as he bids to win his first title since May. ""The 67s I've shot this week have all been a little different and I feel like I've played within myself for all of them, "" said four-time major winner McIlroy of Northern Ireland. ""I feel there's a low round out there for me and hopefully it's tomorrow."" McIlroy was level par for the day after 10 holes, dropping his first shots of the week by three-putting the third and 10th, the latter mistake prompting the 26-year-old to throw his putter at his bag. But he hit back with a birdie on the par-five 11th and a towering four iron from 229 yards on the 13th set up an eagle from just four feet. The former world number one ruptured a ligament in his left ankle during a game of football with friends in July, ruling him out of several tournaments.

CLIFF,xsum,29347895,"He died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months, a statement on his website said. It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date. Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. ""Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,"" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said. ""He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director."" The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: ""I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him."" Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: ""Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him.

CLIFF,xsum,34743526,"Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"". Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming ¬£2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting ¬£1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of ¬£11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to ¬£260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. ""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made."" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than ¬£2.1m. The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low."" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"". He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for ""rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing"".","Lettings agency Investing Solutions has been paid more than ¬£ 2.1 m in housing benefit by a London charity, the BBC has learned.",BART,test,intrinsic,['intrinsic-NP'],['London charity'],['paid by Wandsworth Council '],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mrs Blackburn is now being treated in residential care. Judge Michael Kay QC paused the case for five minutes so Mr Wright could compose himself after he told the court how he had turned his victim's ""world upside down"". Mr Wright said: ""I understand Sylvia was a much-loved lollipop lady, who was loved by the children. ""I am truly sorry for what I have done to her and her family.""

CLIFF,xsum,30453069,"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools, which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 145,000 refugee children in its state school system. But there were still more children arriving than could be taught, he warned. There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged, Mr Thneibat said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan's own education budget, he said. This was in addition to extra costs in health, housing and infrastructure. Without any access to education, he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict.

CLIFF,xsum,37680168,"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year ¬£3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by ¬£1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved ¬£600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted ¬£130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be ¬£76, while another was quoted ¬£70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be ¬£35.

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""

He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights. The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law. Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros. Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months. Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: ""No. Why should we? ""These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues."" The minister added that ""my Polish colleague"" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary. EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously. Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports. Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law. Hungary's Higher Education Law, signed in April, could force the closure of the Budapest-based CEU, which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines.

'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February. Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago. The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time. 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. . Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club. The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining. 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause. 'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.'

CLIFF,cnndm,83d6436741b1022766c9baa31ffc00748fa415ec,"On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled ""Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,"" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal ""what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,"" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans ""targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction."" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book ""Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,"" notes, ""the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems."" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? ""Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!"" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. ""This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it."" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",An NPR report on the unrest in Baltimore focused on tensions between blacks and Asians. Ruben Navarrette: There's little evidence that Asian businesses were targeted out of racial animus. He says the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the 1980s.

The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: ""It was a joke, and no offense was meant."" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: ""We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real."" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised ""money back if he walks"" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday's win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England's final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season.

CLIFF,cnndm,17c80ce62c082281957473d3e7b53e4c88a6203d,"It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .",Barcelona beat Paris Saint - Germain 3 - 1 to reach the Champions League semi - finals.

CLIFF,cnndm,6ecc56a4efa262e37beaad4f46a77a36e22f5c19,"A 17-year-old boy who was shot dead from behind by a police officer had just stolen a handgun, according to the police department in question. Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. . 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. . Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected. Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. . Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60.  .","Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois.

The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show. Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex. Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. . The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. . Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way.

When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'.

Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: ""Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. ""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet."" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. ""From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat.

Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning.

CLIFF,cnndm,83d6436741b1022766c9baa31ffc00748fa415ec,"On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled ""Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,"" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal ""what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,"" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans ""targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction."" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book ""Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,"" notes, ""the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems."" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? ""Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!"" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. ""This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it."" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.","In Baltimore unrest, NPR reported tension between African - Americans and Asian - owned businesses.

This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash . CLERMONT AUVERGNE: N Abendanon; N Nakaitaci, J Davies, W Fofana, N Nalaga; B James, L Radosavljevic; V Debaty, B Kayser, D Zirakashvili, J Cudmore, S Vahaamahina, J Bonnaire, D Chouly (capt), J Bardy. SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt ‚Äî captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. . With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games. In these big games it's often about adapting to the situation and we know we have got a few strings to our bow.' Against a Clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field, Saracens will need all those strings.

CLIFF,cnndm,87fc96df318c8bd4e272be2ec5127b9984dd37b0,"A mother says she must quit her job after her daughter was refused a place at a junior school 150 yards from their front door - and sent to one more than two miles away instead. Seven-year-old Charlotte Briggs was told she cannot attend Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window. . Her mother Lynne, 49, who has two other children, claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job. Unhappy: Charlotte Briggs, seven, was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away, so her mother Lynne, pictured together,  must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back. Decision: The schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to Shooters Grove Primary, which is around two miles away. Mrs Briggs had believed Broomhill Infants School in Sheffield, where Charlotte is a student, was a feeder school to Lydgate Junior, so only put one school on Charlotte's admission form. The mother - who works in IT for Sheffield City Council and is married to financial planner Simon, 55, - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor. But the council said the school Charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying. Charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed, so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her. Mrs Briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away. She said: 'I know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment, we live about as close to the school as possible. . Rejected: Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School (above) in Sheffield, even though she can see it from her bedroom window. 'Parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at Lydgate Juniors. 'The council uses an ""as the crow flies"" criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if I look out of my landing window, all that stands between us and the school are the Kings Court OAP flats and a couple of houses. 'I've been told Broomhill is no longer a feeder school and all the places have been allocated at other infant schools. 'I have looked at bus timetables. I wouldn't be able to drop Charlotte off at school and get into town for work. It would take an hour and five minutes each way twice a day. I simply wouldn't be able to do it.' Jayne Ludlam, the council's executive director of children, young people and families said: 'We do understand that it is difficult if a child cannot be offered a place at their preferred school. . 'We always encourage parents to submit three preferences in case their first preference cannot be accommodated. . Alternative: The seven-year-old was instead offered a place at Shooters Grove - more than two miles away. 'Broomhill Infant School is not and has never been a linked feeder school to Lydgate Junior School and a member of the Admissions Team attended Broomhill in October 2014 to offer help and advice to parents before applying. 'If only one preference is submitted and cannot be accommodated, a place may have to be offered at the nearest school with available places. This may be a school outside the catchment area, if no other preferences were requested. 'If a family has specific reasons for seeking a place at an oversubscribed school they can submit an appeal to the independent appeals panel, which will convene in June and July.' Mrs Briggs said she has contacted her local prospective parliamentary candidates in Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's constituency of Sheffield Hallam - but has yet to receive a reply. . She added: ‚ÄòThe school she has been allocated is down into one valley and down the other side. It's ridiculous. If we were to go by bus it would be a bus into town and then another one out. ‚ÄòIt would take an hour and five minutes to get to school. We are appealing the decision but we won't find out until July what the outcome is, which is very late for us to plan and buy uniforms.‚Äô.",Charlotte Briggs refused a place at Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield.,Pegasus,test,intrinsic,['intrinsic-predicate'],['refused'],['was refused'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff. Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014. .  .",Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished 14th in the Tour of Flanders.

CLIFF,cnndm,0246ddab6a44f81d1b3cfb6d8f3c156d1096158f,"Wayne Rooney knows Champions League qualification is Manchester United's to lose, making this weekend's clash with Aston Villa all the more important. Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League. United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield. The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half. However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday. 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.'

CLIFF,cnndm,15adbace5ad32429ac3e85d964602b70bbae469f,"It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway,. But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night. Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback. Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern. Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' . Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto. Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova. And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.  .",Thiago scored in Bayern Munich's 6 - 1 win over Porto on Tuesday night.

The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,‚Äô said the South African legend. ‚ÄòWhen I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986. Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009. Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters. ‚ÄòNow we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.‚Äô. It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‚Äòbulking up‚Äô too much in the gym. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to guess most of the critics are fat and don‚Äôt watch what they eat,‚Äô he says. ‚ÄòJust because they‚Äôre lazy, they can‚Äôt grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National. ‚ÄòI was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn‚Äôt win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‚ÄòRory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That‚Äôs what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can‚Äôt be bothered to talk to the fans and it‚Äôs so wrong.‚Äô Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‚ÄòI tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòI so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I‚Äôd seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‚ÄòI was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011. Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament. ‚ÄòIt was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?‚Äô. Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. ‚ÄòThere will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,‚Äô said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.

It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. . Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point. The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley. He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well.

Morgan Fox‚Äôs cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. . It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge.

CLIFF,cnndm,84b727701a058446b864bb4c8cc77a113994580a,"While the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq holds the world's gaze, a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention: the deterioration of al Qaeda. In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire ""homegrown"" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.",Al Qaeda confirms two of its leaders were killed in CIA drone strikes in January.

CLIFF,cnndm,3ef37c492fd0b1547f3e34dd04b82e6607c490d5,"A Lithuanian gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave Britain. Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his ‚Äòmanifestly ill-founded‚Äô case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. . This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the ¬£40,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: ‚ÄòThis is a shocking example of Labour‚Äôs Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.‚Äô. Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. . He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius‚Äôs claim that extradition breached his human rights was ‚Äòinadmissible‚Äô. They added: ‚ÄòThe court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.‚Äô .","Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him. 52 - year - old is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, including two murders. spun out legal battle by insisting he was mentally ill.",Pegasus,val,intrinsic,['intrinsic-predicate'],['spun'],['third'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Goyal‚Äô21,cnndm,c811d9ae87c9bfbf31481bf8a916dc0b8e083a60,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- There was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed : The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus . The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it . The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students . That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called `` Jackie , '' especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out . The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012 , and Jackie told the university about it the next spring . She started telling her story very publicly , including at a `` take back the night '' rally . But Charlottesville police did n't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014 , in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face . When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident . In both cases , police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case . But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie 's . Rolling Stone 's story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims . Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus . They 'd call it a `` bad experience . '' Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being `` rapey '' and for using date-rape drugs . That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman 's outfit . And if a woman did report her rape , some women complained that the internal process did n't seem worth it if their abuser would n't be kicked out of school . Rolling Stone had a line in its original story : `` UVA 's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams . And yet paradoxically , not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault . '' After the article published , UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined , so it 's unclear what it means . When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone 's website , that was lost . `` You lose a lot of other people 's voices who were in that article , '' said Sarah Roderick , a survivor and UVA student , `` and a lot of good things that could have come about . Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus '' -- and , she added , across the nationo . Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation , there 's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit . The attorney who filed the suit , James Marsh , told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he 's representing , making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice . When the Columbia Journalism School 's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up , it really boils down to this : The mistake could have been avoided if the writer , Sabrina Rubin Erdely , had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night . They 'd later tell other media outlets , including CNN , that they remembered a very different story . Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag . And all three say they would have talked if they 'd been called . Ryan Duffin , one of the trio , said he felt deceived by Jackie , but he also pointed out that Erdely 's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident , and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost . `` Had she gotten in direct contact with us , it probably would n't have been printed , at least in that way , '' he said . `` A lot of the article was still based in truth , but the focal point would have been different . '' It might have been less dramatic , but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus . `` I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that 's not very common , '' Roderick said . '' ... And I wonder if it would have been different if -LRB- it dealt -RRB- with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people . I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through . Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through . Now it 's like , ` If I was n't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention . ' It 's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm . '' Before the report came out , Abraham Axler , the student body president , said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide . But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress . `` I do feel like there 's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward . If you come forward and share your story , if you do n't have the date right , every detail down , you 'll think , ` I 'm going to be accused of being a liar . It 's easier for me to keep it to myself , ' '' Roderick said . `` There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university 's performance , '' said Steve Coll , dean of the Columbia School of Journalism . `` Rolling Stone teed that subject up . I would n't say that everything about Rolling Stone 's treatment of that subject was perfect , but it certainly does n't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie 's narrative .

'' Clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to Barack Obama . O'Malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month .

'' `` History is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of Iowa , '' O'Malley said .

And they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it . '' O'Malley , like other Democrats , appears to refrain from directly attacking Clinton .

He has , however , openly teased a presidential run . `` I know that , as Democrats , we expect -- and I have heard this all over the country -- the Democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face , '' he said . `` They believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary .

The vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August . But not everyone escaped . ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive . Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot . But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves . In its fourth edition of `` Dabiq , '' the ISIS online magazine , an article titled `` The revival of slavery before the hour , '' outlines the group 's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis . `` One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -LRB- infidels -RRB- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah , '' the article reads . We 're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and can not be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan , 19 , was neither of those things . `` They separated all of us , '' she says . `` They dragged us away by our hair . They took married women , young ones . The youngest with us was just 10 . We were all crying . `` They said we are going to marry you off , you will forget your family . '' ISIS : Enslaving , having sex with ` unbelieving ' women , girls is OK . For the first week , Hanan was held with 50 others , regularly beaten and threatened with torture , and fed just a bowl of rice . The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse , where hundreds of girls and women were held . `` They would line about 50 of us up at a time , in rows of 10 . They would say do n't move , do n't cry or we will beat you . The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased , '' she recalls . She was eventually chosen , part of a group of 25 . From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village . ` Treated like cattle ' : Yazidi women sold , raped , enslaved by ISIS . Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves . `` They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months . She was wearing the black niqab . They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her , '' Hanan says . `` The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me , they cuffed me and raped me . '' Hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape . That night they crawled out the bedroom window . `` The fourth girl jumped out , I was the fifth .

Billboard reports that the singer 's family is creating a version of the singer that will be `` walking , talking , singing and dancing digital embodiment '' of her persona . `` By no means is this something that 's creepy or weird , '' her sister , Suzette Quintanilla , told Billboard . `` We think it 's something amazing . A lot of the new fans that did not get to experience what Selena was about hopefully will be able to get a sense of her with this new technology that 's going to be coming out . '' Selena : 20 years after her death . The technology is being handled by Acrovirt LLC , a Nevada-based tech company . `` Using detailed individual personalized functions spanning the mind , brain and body , the individual 's Digitized Human Essence will autonomously learn and react on behalf of its human counterpart 's , '' the company explained . The project is being called `` Selena the One . '' Twenty years after she was killed by her fan club president , Selena remains incredibly popular , with her Facebook page recording 2 million likes and fans continuing to post videos and tributes . Selena will be the first figure to use the Acrovirt technology , Quintanilla said . `` I 'm excited at the fact that she will be the first ever , and the fact that she 's a Latina makes it even more awesome , '' she said . `` It 's not about replacing Selena in any shape , way or form ; it 's just something to help her legacy continue growing . '' The family intends to expand her legacy in another way : with some new music . Selena the One `` will release new songs and videos , will collaborate with current hit artists , and aims to go on tour in 2018 , '' said a statement on Selena 's Facebook page . Selena is n't the first performer to try the virtual route . A Michael Jackson hologram appeared at the Billboard Music Awards in 2014 , and a hologram of Tupac Shakur performed at Coachella in 2012 . But the new technology is a step forward , Quintanilla said . `` People do n't realize how fast technology is moving , '' she told Billboard . `` This is something that we 're building for another two to three years , so when 2018 comes around they 'll be like , ` Oh , OK , we get it .

'' Those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean 's pop masterpiece `` American Pie . '' It 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8 1/2 minute allegory , which millions of Americans know by heart , is 44 years old . All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as `` Bye , Bye , Miss American Pie . '' There is no real way to categorize McLean 's `` American Pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock . On Tuesday , Christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . McLean was a paperboy when , on February 3 , 1959 , he saw that Buddy Holly , Ritchie Valens and J.P. `` The Big Bopper '' Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake , Iowa . `` The next day I went to school in shock and guess what ? '' McLean recalled . `` Nobody cared . Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 . '' By cathartically writing `` American Pie , '' McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever . Having recorded his first album , `` Tapestry , '' in 1969 , in Berkeley , California , during the student riots , McLean , a native New Yorker , became a kind of weather vane for what he called the `` generation lost in space . '' When his cultural anthem `` American Pie '' was released in November 1971 , it replaced Bob Dylan 's `` The Times They Are A Changin '' as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade . It 's important to think of `` American Pie '' as one would of Henry Longfellow 's `` Evangeline '' or Johnny Mercer 's `` Moon River '' -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection , blues valentine , and youthful protest rolled into one . There is magic brewing in the music and words of `` American Pie , '' for McLean 's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream , like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel `` On the Road . '' Don McLean : Buddy Holly , rest in peace . Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers , McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s , when `` American Pie '' topped the Billboard charts , and has never shed the cape . Wandering far and wide , singing `` American Pie '' at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England , at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley , McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times . Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure . When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing `` and they were singing '' everybody spontaneously joins in with the `` Bye , Bye '' chorus . Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening . What makes `` American Pie '' so unusual is that it is n't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman , which , like a sacred river , keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere . When `` American Pie '' suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it 's almost impossible not to sing along . Like `` Danny Boy '' or `` Streets of Laredo '' or `` Shenandoah , '' it 's eternal . With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll , river levees and nursery rhymes , the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes . After all these years , `` American Pie '' still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss . The song is alive and joyful , yet fretful about a world gone wrong . It is a song that will never die . A reverie for the ages . There is a jump to the chorus , which forces the mind to relive the '50s , '60s and '70s , to troll through the back pages of our lives while , like a traditional Irish folksong , it reminds us of fate . While McLean , the muse , has rightfully not tried to interpret `` American Pie , '' it 's fair to surmise that `` the king '' is Elvis Presley , `` Helter Skelter '' refers to the Charles Manson murders , the `` jester on the sidelines in a cast '' is Bob Dylan , and `` Jack Flash '' the Rolling Stones . But who knows ? The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations . As a literary artifact of the early 1970s , there is n't anything to compare to `` American Pie . '' Normally , I do n't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents , for that matter . But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose `` American Pie '' as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition 's importance as an enduring piece of pop art . The other four were `` Over the Rainbow '' -LRB- by Harold Arlen and E.Y `` Yip '' Harburg -RRB- , `` White Christmas '' -LRB- by Irving Berlin -RRB- , `` This Land is Your Land '' -LRB- by Woody Guthrie -RRB- and `` Respect '' -LRB- by Otis Redding -RRB- . That is fine company . Quite simply , `` American Pie '' is one of the greatest songs ever written .

He is , of course , the Iranian foreign minister . He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . And he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning . `` Long live Zarif , '' crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . You may well have read that he is `` polished '' and , unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues , `` jovial . '' An Internet search for `` Mohammad Javad Zarif '' and `` jovial '' yields thousands of results . He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known . Here are six : . In September 2013 , Zarif tweeted `` Happy Rosh Hashanah , '' referring to the Jewish New Year . That prompted Christine Pelosi , the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own : `` Thanks . The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran 's Holocaust denial , sir . '' And , perhaps to her surprise , Pelosi got a response . `` Iran never denied it , '' Zarif tweeted back . `` The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . Happy New Year . '' The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad 's successor , Hassan Rouhami . His foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that `` due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the United States . '' That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran , which began in 1977 , and during the Iranian Revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . Zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988 . Both of his children were born in the United States . The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry , which Zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . The first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran , says Zarif was `` born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959 . '' Later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as January 8 , 1960 . And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . Whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , Kerry , who is 71 . The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation , a charitable organization . The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions . But last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government , did not mention Zarif 's name . Early in the Iranian Revolution , Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco . The aim , says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif 's memoirs , titled `` Mr. Ambassador '' -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic . Later , the website says , Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations . In response , the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job . In fact , he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland .",u.s. secretary of state john kerry says the iranian foreign minister is a foreign minister.,,val,intrinsic,['intrinsic-predicate'],['says the iranian foreign minister is a foreign minister'],"['the news', 'securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Steve Esmond , his teenage sons and the teens ' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John , where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort . The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States . The boys , 16 and 14 , were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday , the family 's lawyer , James Maron of Delaware , said . `` The boys are in rough shape , '' Maron said . `` The family are all fighters , '' he added . `` They 're fighting for everything right now . I understand it 's a long recovery . '' Esmond , also being treated at a hospital , is conscious but can not move , Maron said . The teens ' mother , Theresa Devine , was treated at a hospital but released , and is now in occupational therapy , Maron said . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses , which were reported to the EPA on March 20 . Paramedics were called to the villa , which the family began had been renting since March 14 . Esmond was found unconscious ; the boys and their mother were having seizures , Maron said . The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics . Elias Rodriguez , an EPA spokesman , said the agency 's preliminary test results `` do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying . '' Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects , including central nervous system and respiratory system damage , according to the EPA . The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity . It 's not allowed to be used indoors . Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings . `` It 's an ongoing investigation ; we 're still on the island doing our assessment , '' Rodriguez said . `` We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling . '' Final test results were expected next week . The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated . Maron , the family 's attorney , declined to comment on the investigation . Depending on the season , the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $ 550 and $ 1,200 per night . Sea Glass Vacations , which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa , said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests , but their unit was not treated . The company said it licensed an outside company , Terminix , for the pest control services . `` Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services , '' the company said in a statement . The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter , according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings , the parent company of Terminix . In an email to CNN , a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is `` committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers , employees , the public and the environment '' and is `` looking into this matter internally , and cooperating with authorities . '' `` We 're thinking about the family , and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery , '' Terminix wrote . The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as `` serious .

But now it 's his former female companion who has lost big . A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $ 2.6 million in gifts after Sterling 's wife sued her . In the lawsuit , Rochelle `` Shelly '' Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men . She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple 's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari , two Bentleys and a Range Rover , and that he helped her get a $ 1.8 million duplex . Who is V. Stiviano ? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner , who made much of his fortune in real estate . Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday , her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC . `` This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $ 2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress , '' attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement . `` It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts .

Goyal‚Äô21,cnndm,3f034e41bd128350195c9dd75a74258f86b1fd06,"Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- Former rap mogul Marion `` Suge '' Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic `` Straight Outta Compton '' earlier this year . In addition to that ruling , Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight 's bail to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , a figure that defense lawyers called excessive . The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight . In all , Knight will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run , the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday . Knight , 49 , faces up to life in prison if convicted . Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots , and the case has clearly strained him : He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $ 25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment . Knight was in court Thursday . At the end of hearing , he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery , and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom . In a press conference after the hearing , fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight 's health that he is `` doing much better . '' The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon , in this case the vehicle Knight was driving , is used against several people . Knight is accused of running over two men , killing one of them , during an argument . Killed was Terry Carter , 55 . The survivor is Cle Sloan , 51 , who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan does n't want to be a `` snitch '' who sends Knight to prison , according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA . Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity , but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday , the affiliates reported . The deadly incident happened on January 29 , after a flare-up on the set of the biopic `` Straight Outta Compton , '' a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. . The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam 's Burgers in Compton . At the time , Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case . The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck . In the video , the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant , and he is then approached by Sloan , who was working security on the site . The two men appear to talk for a few moments , with Knight still in his vehicle . Suddenly , the vehicle backs up , knocking Sloan to the ground . While still in reverse , the truck moves out of range of the security camera . The vehicle is then seen zooming forward , back into camera range , running over Sloan a second time , and then running over a second man , Carter , a former rap music label owner . Carter later died . In closing arguments prior to the judge 's ruling , Knight 's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim . Knight was only defending himself against Sloan , whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time . `` Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor , '' Knight 's attorney argued . `` There 's no intent to kill , there 's an intent to survive . '' `` Even without a gun , we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight , '' the defense attorney said . Fletcher added that Knight 's defense was to stand his ground . Sloan `` needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor , '' Fletcher said . `` He is the person who got Terry -LRB- Carter -RRB- killed . '' Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued , however , told the judge that Knight was engaged in `` mutual combat situation '' where he used his car as deadly weapon . If Knight `` ever had the right of self-defense , the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over , he lost the right of self-defense , '' Barnes said . `` There was pre-mediation and intent when he -LRB- Knight -RRB- ran over him a second time . '' Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30 . The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight , who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg -LRB- now known as Snoop Lion -RRB- and Tupac Shakur . Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996 . Shortly afterward , Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions . That prison time -- along with Shakur 's death , feuds between Knight and a number of rappers , and desertions by Dr. Dre , Snoop and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006 . In August , Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards .","he suffers from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic ""straight outta compton"" earlier this year.",,test,intrinsic,['intrinsic-predicate'],['suffers from (faces charges stemming from)'],"[""Former rap mogul Marion `` Suge' Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Israel and the United States , neither of which is an ICC member , opposed the Palestinians ' efforts to join the body . But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki , speaking at Wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an ICC news release . `` Indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' Judge Kuniko Ozaki , a vice president of the ICC , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians . `` As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine , Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute . These are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development . `` Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said Balkees Jarrah , international justice counsel for the group . `` What 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not Palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' In January , when the preliminary ICC examination was opened , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . The United States also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` As we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC , '' the State Department said in a statement . It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` Palestine . '' While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality .

Goyal‚Äô21,cnndm,2dac7b4a9ed9eb9cfcabae0e8e0eb07abc5b8860,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- After two days of deliberation , jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing . The verdict is n't surprising . What might be , however , is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again . Because there could be other more young men just like him , which means the lessons we take from Boston will affect whether we can keep America and Americans safer . Today , nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are Muslim . By 2050 , Pew reports , that will be some 1 out of 3 . By 2070 ? Well , I 'll quote the all-caps headline reprinted by the Drudge Report : `` Muslims to outnumber Christians ! '' Many Americans read such numbers and worry : Will this mean more Dzhokhar Tsarnaevs ? But that 's only if you believe Islam causes extremism , which many have argued . And that 's wrong , of course . On the other hand , there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism . Which is true -- and false . Sure , the Islamic faith forbids murder , but there 's a small but significant minority of Muslims murdering people in terrible ways , and in Islam 's name . Understanding what leads young Muslims like Dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization . At any given moment in the Middle East , we have little idea who 's going to attack whom next , who 's on whom 's side , how this is going to end , or what anyone 's even fighting over anymore . This bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better . But it will get better . To understand why , we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes Muslims . Contrary to common belief , Muslims are n't unusually predisposed to violence . Radical Islam , which has taken on an ugly life of its own , began at the intersection of politics , religion and religious identity . Islam is about what you believe , but it 's also about being part of a community . And what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack ? Some Muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions -LRB- the road to hell , after all -RRB- . Consider : The tragedy of modern Islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies . Before my time , the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan horrified many Muslims . When I was in high school , Bosnia occupied all our attention . There was of course Russia 's brutal war on the Chechen people -- Dzhokhar shares his name with a recent Chechen patriot -- and Israel 's ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories . And the blows against Muslims do n't end there . There was Serbia 's war on Kosovo , another war in Chechnya , the invasion of Iraq , oppression in Myanmar , civil strife in Syria , the colonization of East Turkestan , massacres of Muslims in the Central African Republic , wars on a besieged Gaza and West Bank still under Israeli rule . Imagine how this looks to a restless young Muslim . Countless places where co-religionists have been killed , and nobody seems to do anything about it . Nobody even wants to . Extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening , and then moved quickly to a single , tempting , terrible response : Take up arms -- and kill . In her new book , `` Heretic : Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now '' , Ayaan Hirsi Ali argues that extremism is n't caused by political circumstances , but by Islam itself . Her conclusion is wrong . To fight extremism , we do n't need to reform Islam . We need to show young Muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to . Rather than help Muslims , it 's harming them . When I was a teenager , our Massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from Bosnia that shared graphic , heartbreaking stories of rape , exile , and massacre inflicted on Muslims , all because of their faith . The mosque raised money , collected food , blankets , medicine . Promises were made to provide more , and regularly . But we all knew that was n't enough . As we left the mosque , my peers and I were disgruntled and confused . Shocked . Angry . Our teachers could 've told us : Go and fight . Defend your Muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege . Or they could 've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably . Neither answer would have satisfied . Fortunately for us , they offered us a third way . They showed us , patiently , how to work with others , how to compromise , how to get things done . A more engaged American Muslim community , they explained , could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world . They were right . We saw the dead-end road of radicalism from afar , but we also saw , up close , how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless , ineffectual and ignored . Thanks to social media , a medium that the world 's burgeoning young Muslim population is increasingly comfortable with , more Muslims can and will see this , too . Radicalism will be done in by fellow Muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it . It 's happening already . Our national conversation about Islam is focused on the wrong issues . Does Islam need a Reformation ? What in Islam causes violence ? We would do a lot better if we accepted that Muslims the world over have real grievances -- dictatorships , corruption , foreign intervention , religious illiteracy , lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these . We need to show the young Dzhokhars that , if they want to help , then violence is n't going to help . To fight extremism , we need to pose this question to young Muslims : `` Do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith ? '' Because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse . Their narrative has failed . Their solution is bankrupt . The Caliph wears no clothes . It 's the reason why increasing numbers of Muslims reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing .",the tsarnaev says it's a 1 out of 4 people in a world.,,test,intrinsic,['intrinsic-NP'],"['the tsarnaev', 'people in a world']","[' jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing', 'people in the world are Muslim']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Thursday massacre was the most deadly assault so far , with 147 dead , easily eclipsing the terrorist group 's most notorious attack , a four-day siege in late September 2013 at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed . After the Westgate attack , Al-Shabaab unleashed a string of attacks in Kenya that have killed more than 100 people -- assaulting the coastal town of Mpeketoni on June 16 , 2014 ; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the Quran on November 22 , 2014 ; and then , days later , executing Christian quarry laborers . Why is Al-Shabaab , a Somali nationalist , Islamist group affiliated with al Qaeda , targeting Kenya ? Al-Shabaab says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 Kenyan soldiers participating in the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia . But if that is the case , why does n't Al-Shabaab target Kenyan military bases rather than attacking undefended so-called soft targets such as Kenyan malls and universities ? In fact , Thursday 's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of Al-Shabaab , which has steadily been losing ground for years in Somalia as a result of the African Union forces fighting them there , as well as a covert U.S. drone and Special Operations Forces campaign that has also degraded the group 's capabilities . In 2006 , Al-Shabaab controlled the Somali capital of Mogadishu and , in the following years , much of central and southern Somalia . Six years later , African Union forces had recaptured Mogadishu , parts of southern Somalia and critical cities such as Kismayo . The loss of Kismayo , Al-Shabaab 's last city stronghold and an important port , took a financial toll on the group . Ground battles with African Union forces have decimated Al-Shabaab 's rank-and-file , while U.S. drone strikes and Special Operations raids have killed some of the group 's leaders . In the past four years , according to a count by New America , the U.S. has launched a dozen drone strikes and six Special Operations raids against Al-Shabaab . These strikes and raids -- almost all occurring in southern Somalia -- have targeted the terrorist group 's training camps and leaders . American drones or special operators have killed 10 leaders : Aden Hashi Ayro , the top commander ; Ahmed Abdi Godane , Ayro 's successor ; a top commander , Sheikh Muhidin Mohamud Omar ; Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , a senior official who operated training camps ; commander Jabreel Malik Muhammed ; Bilal al-Berjawi , the deputy of military leader Fazul Abdullah Mohammed ; chief bomb-maker Ibrahim Ali Abdi ; intelligence chief Tahlil Abdishakur ; Yusef Dheeq , the chief of external operations and planning for intelligence and security ; and Adan Garar , who was involved in planning the Westgate Mall attack . Al-Shabaab has been unraveling for years . Thursday 's attack should remind the world that the group is a pale shadow of the organization that once dominated much of Somalia but now is reduced to high profile attacks against undefended civilian targets .",garissa university college is al-shabaab's fifth major assault in kenya in the past year.,,test,intrinsic,['intrinsic-NP'],['garissa university college is'],"[""This week 's attack on Garissa University College"", 'in the past year and a half']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xsumfaith,xsum,13599161,"Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months.
It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume.
A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said.
Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions.
Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts.
""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that.""
The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite.
But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice.
The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.
In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.
""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.""
The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.
Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.
""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.
""Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).
""The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.""",shale gas drilling in lancashire has been suspended after a magnitude-7. 5 earthquake struck.,BERTS2S,val,extrinsic,['extrinsic-NP'],['7. 5'],['1.5'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xsumfaith,xsum,34793274,"The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars.
MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board.
Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations.
This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau.
The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems.
The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered.
Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time.
The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it.
The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.
In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane.
Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""
The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

xsumfaith,xsum,36404868,"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points.
This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.
Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality
The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.
Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.
This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.
In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.
They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.
Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.
They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.
But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.
There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.
Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.
In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.
Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.
Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.
But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.
So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.
Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.
So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?
Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.
It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.
This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.
The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.
Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.
They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it.
But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

xsumfaith,xsum,32715299,"It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters.
It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences.
For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves.
U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships.
Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker.
When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds.
Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search.
He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity.
There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK.
He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"".
For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy.
It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack.
Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope.
Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors.
Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship.
He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines.
But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout.""
Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy.
But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength.
While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his.
Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters.
Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"".
Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development.
He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled.
They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"".
When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time.
Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves.
They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and ""fingerprinting"" other nations' submarines and warships.
For this exercise, curiously named ""Dynamic Mongoose"", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search.
For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean.
Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed.
It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea.
Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise.
They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance.
Underwater drones are for the future.
But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft.
These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean.
For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft.
Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below.
Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences.
Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters.
RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a ""key vulnerability"".
He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland.
Britain, he says, should be ""exceptionally worried"" that it is seen as a ""soft touch"", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace.
The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare.
But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone.
The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review.

His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.
The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.
The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed ""aggressively"" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.
""It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office,"" Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.

Google paid √Ç¬£10m in UK corporate taxes between 2006 and 2011.
Mr Schmidt said it was up to the government to change its tax system if it wanted companies to pay more taxes.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week, he said: ""What we are doing is legal. I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional.
""I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes.
""If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom.""
Meanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms.
She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules.

Rigging supervisor Steve Innes, from Sunderland, told the BBC he and fellow Wood Group contractors discovered they had been exposed to alpha radiation.
EnQuest said ""additional precautionary steps"" had since been taken.
Wood Group said it was committed to employee safety.
Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears, and blood tests were ongoing.
He said EnQuest had failed in its duty of care.
The men were working at Thistle, 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland, doing shutdown work with pipe equipment.
Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip.
He claimed a health and safety manager told them a reading had been taken the night before and all the work was stopped.
He said: ""We had all been working on it without the proper PPE (personal protective equipment), because they had assumed it was clear.
""At first we were all in shock.
""We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time.""
He said they had been told the levels of radiation may not cause them long-term harm, but he was continuing to undergo tests.
Mr Innes said of EnQuest: ""They have a duty of care. Their procedures have broken down.
""You can't say 'you've been contaminated but we think you'll be OK'.
""I would like somebody to take the case on who's not frightened of the companies.""
An EnQuest spokesperson said: ""EnQuest can confirm that, in December 2016, during planned shutdown activities on its Thistle platform, six personnel employed by Wood Group under a contract with EnQuest were removing a piece of pipework when they were exposed to low levels of NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material).
""The level of exposure was less than 1% of the level at which it is reportable to the Health and Safety Executive however EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter at the time.
""EnQuest has appropriate control measures in place which are designed to prevent exposure to NORM.
""Following an investigation, additional precautionary steps have been taken to further ensure that personnel avoid any such exposure.""
A Wood Group spokeswoman said: ""The health and safety of our people is always our top priority.
""As a precaution following the incident, we downmanned our employees from the platform in order to conduct medical assessments.
""We fully supported EnQuest in a detailed joint investigation and continue to reinforce the application of our health and safety procedures, to ensure the safety of our employees.
""Our commitment and priority following the incident and throughout the investigation has been to the health and wellbeing of our employees.""
John Boland, regional officer for the Unite union, said: ""Unite believes that the way these workers has been treated is terrible.

xsumfaith,xsum,37565125,"Temperton died in London last week at the age of 66 after ""a brief aggressive battle with cancer"", Jon Platt of Warner/Chappell music publishing said.
Temperton's other hits included Off The Wall and Baby Be Mine for Jackson and Boogie Nights for his band Heatwave.
Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers was among those paying tribute, tweeting: ""Your genius gave us a funkier world!""
Michael Jackson's sister LaToya wrote: ""A brilliant prolific #songwriter Rod Temperton may you #RIP one of my favorite #songs Rock With You #Thriller #legend #Music #MichaelJackson""
Producer and DJ Mark Ronson wrote: ""So devastated to hear that Rod Temperton has passed away. a wonderful man & one of my favourite songwriters ever. thank you for the magic x""
Temperton, whose private funeral has taken place, was nicknamed The Invisible Man because of his low profile.
Born in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, Temperton traced his songwriting ability back to his father's influence.
""My father wasn't the kind of person who would read you a story before you went off to sleep,"" he once said.
""He used to put a transistor radio in the crib and I would go to sleep listening to Radio Luxembourg, and I think somehow that had an influence.""
In the 1970s, after a spell working in a frozen food factory in Grimsby, he answered an advert in Melody Maker magazine for a keyboardist.
The band he joined was disco group Heatwave, and his songs like Boogie Nights, Always & Forever and Groove Line became big hits for the band in the 1970s.
By the time he left the band in 1978, his tunes had caught the attention of producer Quincy Jones, who was looking for songwriters for a new Michael Jackson LP.
Temperton penned three songs for Off The Wall, which became Jackson's breakthrough solo album - the title track, Rock With You and Burn This Disco Out.
He went on to write three more for follow-up Thriller - the title track, which became one of Jackson's signature smashes, plus Baby Be Mine and The Lady in My Life.
They helped make Thriller the best-selling album of all time in the US, with 32 million copies sold.
His tunes have also been recorded by artists including Anita Baker, Donna Summer, Aretha Franklin and The Brothers Johnson.
Temperton won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his work on Birdland, from Quincy Jones's album Back on the Block.
He was nominated for two Oscars in 1986 for his work with Jones on the soundtrack for The Color Purple.
He once summed up his approach to songwriting: ""The first criteria is write something you love first, and once you feel those hairs standing up on the back of your hand, you can go to the world.""
In a statement released on Wednesday, Warner/Chappell's Jon Platt said: ""His family is devastated and request total privacy at this, the saddest of sad times.""
Vocalist Chaka Khan, who recorded Temperton's tracks with the funk band Rufus, paid tribute, writing on Twitter: ""Thank u 4 your superlative songwriting @RodTemperton. U will always Live in Me. Rest in power.""

She added: ""God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx.""
The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media.
Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd.
The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond.
The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell.
On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell.
Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson.
The teenager wrote on his page: ""I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.
""I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.
""Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.""
At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity.
The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months.
He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked.
Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school.
On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment.
At the time, Jak wrote: ""This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have.
""I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.
""I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me.""
In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research.
After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike.

xsumfaith,xsum,40422011,"The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.
The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.
In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.
Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.
It can take Europe‚Äôs biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today‚Äôs specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.
That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.
The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.
The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.
""Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.
""Here, we‚Äôve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,"" he told BBC News.
Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.
The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the ""revolution"" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.
The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.
Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.
The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.
More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.
There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.
OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.
Equity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a ""truly global company"" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.
""A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,"" said OneWeb CEO Eric B√©ranger.
""And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.""
One aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.
The fear is that space could eventually become unusable.
A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.
Brian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.
""We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,"" he told BBC News.
""We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.""
Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.
Airbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.
""Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,‚Äù said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.

In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny.
Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet?""
Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory.
Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory
""It's like playing Russian roulette,"" Lorna says. ""Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful.
""My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty.""
Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people.
There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they?
They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet  the needs of people who use them.
Mike LeSurf, Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says: ""There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met.""
Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away.
""Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet,"" she says.
""You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you're last in the line to be considered.
""It's soul-destroying and you don't feel like a valued member of society at all.""
But it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends.
She said: ""Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a 'pop-up' changing places, and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazing""
Alison even tweeted from the party: ""Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a 'pop up' #changingplace so ALL can go!""
Bethan Folen and her daughter Lowri also enjoy their ""girls' days out"" now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby.
She said: ""Lowri's favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium [now known as the Principality Stadium] in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby. She is a massive fan.
Even before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, ""There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Lowri""
Changing Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement.
Architect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem.
""By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,"" she says.
""As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this.""
For businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans.
At 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m).
Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations.
Arsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too.
Alun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: ""There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt.
""But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience.
""They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible.
""You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.""",change is a problem for many disabled people.,BERTS2S,val,intrinsic,['intrinsic-NP'],['change'],['truly accessible toilet facilities'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships.
The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted.
Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March.
A final decision is not expected until the spring.
The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field.
Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard.
She added: ""For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life.

Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its entire stockpile.
Mr Mekdad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia.
""We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast,"" he said. ""The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups.""
He added: ""This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration.""
He described as ""absolutely unacceptable"" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters.
Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area.
""We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians,"" Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of ""still supporting terrorist elements"" in the country.
The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees.
But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had ""thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups"".
The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison.
It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions.
Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons.
The US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country.
US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was ""concerned"" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus ""had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment"".
Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March.

One-year-old Teenie was found injured by her owner Sarah Nisbett in NiddryView, Winchburgh, at about 16:30 on Friday 14 March and taken to the Scottish SPCA.
Mrs Nisbett said the cat was now having to learn how to walk again.

xsumfaith,xsum,30216408,"But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices.
The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools.
Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations.
The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home.
Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group.
But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.
The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.
The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.
Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.
But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.
Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.
But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.
And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.
Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.
""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said.
A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.
It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.
The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.
Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"".
About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.
Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.
It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.
Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.
Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.
Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"".
The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"".
Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.
The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.

‚ÄúHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?‚Äù shouted a producer in London. ‚ÄúIf not, why not?‚Äù
This appeared to be an impossible demand.
Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.
Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple‚Äôs marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.
He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O‚ÄôClock News piece.
The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were ‚Äúa fragment of the true cross‚Äù, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.
I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we‚Äôd had a TV news bulletin back then.
Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?
But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.
One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It‚Äôs not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.
Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.
This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.
My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.

xsumfaith,xsum,40899859,"The newly-designed form, used to apply for a divorce in England and Wales, asks for the name ""of the person your spouse has committed adultery with"".
Family lawyers say that, in most cases, involving a third party adds ""conflict and complexity"".
The Ministry of Justice said there was ""no obligation"" to name people.
Lawyer Margaret Heathcote, vice-chairwoman of family law group Resolution, is one of those concerned about the form.
""Generally speaking, we don't name the third party. It increases the conflict from day one,"" she said.
""There's no need. But because the box is there, the indication will be to fill it in.""
The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice.
The guidance on the form highlights that it is ""not normally necessary"" to name the person your spouse committed adultery with.
But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are ""unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it"".
The older version of the form left a space for so-called ""co-respondents"" to be named where appropriate.
""The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with',"" Ms Hamblin explained.
""This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse.""
If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case.
They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs.
According to the latest statistics, there were just over 100,000 divorces granted in England and Wales in 2015.
Adultery was the reason for 12,148 of them. ""Unreasonable behaviour"" accounted for 46,815.
Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery ""want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them"".
""But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that,"" she said.
""Judges take a very dim view of petitioners trying to bring in new partners and embroil them in proceedings.""
When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons:

The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break.
Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time.
Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack.
Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't.
The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline.
The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin.
Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.

Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell.
The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw.
The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality.
Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though.
Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth.
Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points.
""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball.
""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.
""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.
The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.
Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.
He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.
But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.
Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.
Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.
But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.
He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet.
""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.
""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.""
The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.
A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"".

All of the threats made on Monday, along with previous incidents in January, turned out to be false and Jewish centres have since reopened with normal services resumed.

How Srebrenica's survivors view Aleppo
What's happening in Aleppo?
What happens next?
The evacuation of civilians, rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed.
""Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded, including children, were brought out,"" the head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said after two convoys left.
""No-one knows how many people are left in the east, and the evacuation could take days,"" she added.
The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province.
US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out ""nothing short of a massacre"" in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva.
""The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime, with Russia's support, is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively, and whether or not they're willing to stop this slaughter of their own people,"" he said in Washington.
John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year's worth of US-Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks.
But he didn't offer any new plan to end the conflict. Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. ""You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,"" he told me.
Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith.
Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - ""delusional diplomacy"", the Washington Post called it.
Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one.
Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city.
A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo.
The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.
As operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured.
The White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances.
Buses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.
The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal.
The chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: ""A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.""
""This corridor is 21km long,"" he said, adding, ""6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.""
Turkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.
In a televised address, he said Turkey would take ""children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions"".
The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred.
UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.
""If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo,"" he told reporters in Paris.
The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members.
Aleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages.
Russian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years.
In October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be ""the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists"", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters.
He singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.
Idlib contains border crossings used by rebels to receive supplies from Turkey, a key backer.

The festival is running until 9 September and bringing together leading artists from across the world.
Turning Points was premiered at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff on Wednesday night.
Tally Evans said his film celebrated life changing moments when a meeting, an event, or something unexpected led to a new and better direction.
It started as a nationwide story-telling project aimed at inspiring and changing the lives of others by collecting stories from people of all ages, abilities and walks of life.
Tally Evans, who has written and presented programmes for BBC TV and radio, said: ""It's fantastic to get the chance to have my work included in such a momentous festival and I'm looking forward to the film transferring to the Southbank Centre in London (from 31 August to 9 September).""
""I think it was meeting a man in Hollywood, a dialogue director called Joe Graham.
""Warner Brothers thought that I sounded too English. They said: 'We'd like you to work with this dialogue coach.'
""He said: 'You think we're all born the same?' I said: 'Of course we are.' He said: 'Some people are lucky, they're born 6ft 4ins and some people are born 3ft 2ins. Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye.'
""I said: 'That's the luck of the draw, isn't it?'. He said: 'Yes, but the big sin is if you don't use what you've got'. He said: 'You're 6ft 1ins and you only stand 5ft 9ins, so if you believe we're all born the same way then why don't you stand your full height?""
""He said did you go to university? I said: 'No'. He said: 'Do you regret that?' I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.
""He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.
""He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'.
And it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.""
There will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.
""It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience,"" added Tally Evans.
""There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.""
Sir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996.
Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted.
Tally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape.
Vibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion.
There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas.
In the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted.
A social worker told him his life was going to be different, and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a ""very unhappy man"".
""I refused rehab, where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper, grateful disabled person, threw the Braille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted,"" Tally Evans said.
""I never saw my social worker again.""
The film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart.
Nick Capaldi, Arts Council of Wales chief executive, said: ""Chris Tally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape.""",a film based on sir roger gwent\'s life has been released in london.,BERTS2S,val,extrinsic,['extrinsic-predicate'],"[""a film based on sir roger gwent\\'s life',  has been released in london""]","['a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape', 'premiered at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pollsters Ipsos Mori asked voters to give a score out of 10 to a range of policies which could be implemented by the next UK government.
A ranking of one meant it should not be implemented, while 10 meant it should be implemented immediately.
Ipsos Mori surveyed more than 1,000 adults between 19 and 25 March.

Many of those questioned seemed to favour going beyond the Smith Commission proposals, which suggested that Holyrood should control income tax rates and bands as well as some welfare benefits.
Give Holyrood full control of income tax 6.8
Increase top rate of tax to 50p 7.2
Increase minimum wage to ¬£7.85 8.2
The most popular of the policy statements in this category was that of giving Holyrood the power to increase benefits and old age pensions, which scored 7.3 out of 10 on the scale.
Close behind was the notion that the Scottish Parliament should have full control of welfare benefits, with a score of 7.1.
Scots appear to place a greater emphasis on embedding and extending powers at Holyrood parliament than on holding a second independence referendum.
When asked to give a score of between 1 and 10, where 10 is an important priority and should be done quickly, each of the four issues relating to additional powers for the Scottish Parliament achieved high average scores.
Giving Holyrood power to increase benefits and pensions achieved an average score of 7.3 out of 10, a little higher than devolving full control of welfare benefits (7.1), full control of income tax (6.8) and full control of all policy other than defence and foreign affairs (6.5).
Interestingly, analysis shows that, for each of these issues, support is higher among groups who are more likely to have voted 'Yes' in last year's referendum.
Read Mark's analysis of the poll.
The idea that Holyrood should have full control of income tax was given a score of 6.8.
Still popular, but a bit further down the ranking with a score of 6.5, was the suggestion that Holyrood should control all areas of policy apart from defence and foreign affairs - what most analysts call full fiscal autonomy.
The results of the poll suggested that voters would rather have a referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union than another referendum on Scottish independence.
Voters gave the policy statement ""hold another referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years"" a score of 5.6 out of 10.
Cap amount paid in welfare to a household 6.3
Limit numbers coming to live in UK 6.3
Give Holyrood full control of welfare 7.1
The policy statement ""hold a referendum to ask people whether they wish to stay in or leave the European Union"" was slightly more popular, with a score of 6.1 out of 10.
The idea of stopping immigrants from the rest of the European Union from claiming welfare benefits until they have been in the UK for four years scored 6.8.
The policy of putting a limit on the number of people coming to live in the UK was less popular, with a score of 6.3.
As ever, how much the next government should spend and how much it should tax is proving to be one of the central issues of the UK general election campaign.
And there seems to be little doubt as to where the majority of Scots stand on this issue, at least if the evidence of BBC Scotland's issues poll is to be believed.

xsumfaith,xsum,22534665,"She stressed that to kill a police officer was ""to attack the fundamental basis of our society"".
But Mrs May also said police officers must end ""frivolous"" accident claims and focus on raising public trust.
Earlier the Police Federation urged her not to base legislation changes on the behaviour of a ""handful of officers"".
During her address, Mrs May said suing someone after slipping on their property was ""not the sort of attitude"" officers should exhibit.
Her comments come after it emerged recently that one police officer, PC Kelly Jones, had taken legal action after tripping on a kerb at a Norfolk petrol station in August.
Mrs May also revealed plans to allow police to take over shoplifting prosecutions where goods taken were worth less than √Ç¬£200.
Unveiling plans for a change in legislation at the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth, Mrs May announced the government proposal that the minimum term for killing an officer should be increased to life without parole.
The current minimum sentence for a police murder is 30 years.
By Danny ShawBBC home affairs correspondent
Theresa May's whole life tariff for police murderers is being welcomed by rank-and-file officers - but it's unlikely to quell the anger felt by Police Federation members about the government's programme of cuts and reforms to the service.
High on their list of concerns is an idea, currently the subject of negotiation, which would allow chief constables to make police compulsorily redundant.
Officers say chiefs could get rid of officers they don't like or those approaching pension age - and with no industrial rights there'd be nothing police could do about it.
A final decision on whether the home secretary will go ahead is expected in the summer. The federation would no doubt toast Mrs May if she abandoned the whole idea.
The home secretary told rank-and-file officers the murder of a police officer was ""a particularly appalling crime"".
""We ask police officers to keep us safe by confronting and stopping violent criminals for us,"" she said.
""And sometimes you are targeted by criminals because of what you represent.""
She added: ""We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.""
The Criminal Justice Act 2003 permits Justice Secretary Chris Grayling - following consultation with the Sentencing Council - to make an order to change starting points for sentences.
In this instance, it enables him to change the starting point from 30 years to a whole life order, meaning offenders could not be released other than at the discretion of the secretary of state on compassionate grounds - for example, if they are terminally ill or seriously incapacitated.
The Sentencing Council, the official body that oversees sentencing in England and Wales, issues guidelines for judges and magistrates to work to for all offences other than murder.
A spokesman said: ""Introducing whole life tariffs for those who murder police officers would involve changes to the law, which is a matter for Parliament, rather than the Sentencing Council.""
But he confirmed that the government had a duty to consult with the council before new legislation could be brought in.
The Sentencing Council says that, as things stand, whole life orders can be imposed in murder cases ""if the court decides that the offence is so serious that the offender should spend the rest of their life in prison"".
There are currently 47 prisoners in England and Wales who have been given whole life tariffs, including Rosemary West and ""Yorkshire Ripper"" Peter Sutcliffe.
The home secretary, who faced a question and answer session after her speech, was heckled at last year's conference after she told officers to ""stop pretending"" they were being singled out and would ""have to make their share"" of public spending cuts.
Police Federation chairman Steve Williams, who had earlier welcomed Mrs May's sentencing plan, told her morale was low as a result of the government's programme of cuts and reforms.
Speaking at the conference, he urged the home secretary not to ""hang your reforms on the reprehensible behaviour of a handful of officers"".
The biggest applause came when he called for the government to abandon plans for compulsory severance, which are currently subject to negotiation.
Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor, who is behind hotly debated changes such as fast-track recruitment and lower annual pay for new constables, was also due to address officers.

The council announced on Monday that a single element of the cladding system, added to the 16-storey tower block during a recent refurbishment, had failed new fire tests.
Hanover House resident and tenants association member John Cawthorne said: ""I personally feel betrayed.""
Ms Dunn, cabinet member for neighbourhoods and community safety, said the issue had been discovered following independent testing of the cladding at the council's 24 tower blocks.
She said testing had been carried out despite paperwork stating ""there was absolutely no cladding apart from aluminium on our buildings"".
""It's only when you cut in to it that you can see the layers,"" she continued.
""I can guarantee you that we will not stop until we get to the bottom of it because they took a piece of cladding to the tenants at a consultation and they didn't put that up.
""That was the cladding that we asked for. That was the cladding that we were told was on the building.""
Mr Cawthorne said: ""The Tenants Association were given samples, which I kept for eight years, and those samples are 3mm aluminium sheet.
""That's what the council asked to be put on this building, but that's not what was discovered on this building when the tests were carried out.

David Knight was killed by a train near St Austell after going on leave from a Somerset hospital.
The Department of Health has admitted ""unacceptable"" patients ""are receiving care far from home"".

BBS South West Political Reporter Tamsin Melville said county coroner Dr Emma Carlyon was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment.
An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died.
A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset.
The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.
The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015/16, 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months, and 60 the year before that.
The Department of Health said it had increased mental health funding to √Ç¬£11.7bn and had accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care ""must be eliminated by 2020/21"".

xsumfaith,xsum,13569129,"It was scrapped this week at the eleventh hour when the government removed it from parliament moments before it was due to be voted into law.
Under the proposal, which had already passed a first round of voting, it would have been illegal to share information electronically that could ""destroy, alter or subvert state institutions"" or ""damage national integrity or independence"".
This would have meant anyone criticising the government on social networking sites such as Facebook, or receiving an email containing anti-government sentiment, could have faced up to 12 years in prison.
The law also wanted to ban the online sharing of videos, pictures or recordings without the subject's consent, criminalise ""whistle-blowing"" under the crime of ""espionage"" and make it illegal for anyone to search for information about the state, even if it was not classified.
Minister of State Carlos Feijo told reporters in the capital, Luanda, that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision.
But many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists, who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was ""totalitarian"" and violated basic freedom of expression, played a role in the decision to abandon the law.
US-based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have ""undercut both freedom of expression and information, and posed a severe threat to independent media, whistle-blowers, and investigative journalism"".
With most of Angola's traditional media controlled by the state, or owned by government ministers and their business associates, there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio.
Opposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time, while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin.
Civil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet, even though only 1% of Angolans have access to the web, to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites.
In recent months, several anti-government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook, where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There, people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public.
Angolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online, creating websites to rally support for regime change, and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa, the UK and Belgium.
Many are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country's oil wealth among the majority, two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity.
The introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest.
In an uncharacteristically emotional speech last month, President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites, saying they were being used to ""insult, denigrate and provoke uproar and confusion"".
Officially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography, hacking and online financial fraud.
The editor of the private weekly newspaper Angolense, Suzana Mendes, who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law, welcomed its withdrawal.
""The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important, because if it had been approved, it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed,"" she told the BBC.
Sizaltina Cutaia, from the Angolan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (Osisa), which also opposed the bill, said they were pleased the government had backed down.
""This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across."" she said.
However, civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-poverty demonstration in Luanda.
Organised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Intervention (MRIS), the protest was due to take place at lunchtime.
But following the arrest of MRIS leader Luis Bernardo, allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Cazenga, only a few dozen people gathered in the city square.
According to reports, between 15 and 20 people were detained, among them a journalist and a representative from Osisa who had been trying to film the arrests.
They were later released and rejoined the protest, which at its height numbered around 100 people.
A spokesman for Luanda's provincial government told state media that the youth involved, who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest, had acted ""criminally"" and the police force was within its rights to respond.
""What the government needs to realise is that the more they repress people, the more they will want to demonstrate,"" Ms Cutaia said.
Although small in size and number, protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MPLA.
""The people leading these protests are young and they don't have as much to lose. They were born after independence so they don't have that connection to the ruling party like older generations,"" Ms Cutaia says.
""All they see is that despite Angola's wealth under the MPLA most people have remained poor and they want that to change.

Police had said they were trying to build a picture of Ms Fleming's life, part of which she kept ""quite private"".
When last seen, she was wearing a green tartan fleece or jumper, dark jeans or trousers, and dark Karrimor-type boots. She also had a satchel-type handbag.

He and his mother were then reunited with his father in Tampa, Florida where he had fled two years earlier.
But Fernandez's transition from his life in Cuba was difficult. Baseball helped him acclimate to his new American life.
After starting at Alonso High School in Tampa, speaking almost no English, Fernandez steered the baseball team to two state championships.
He was drafted by the Marlins in 2011 at 20 years old and named National League Rookie of the Year in 2013.
The Miami Herald reported his grandmother, a loyal supporter, often stood on her roof in Cuba during his games to listen to the sports radio broadcast as her grandson played.
Players and fans described him as enthusiastic, energetic and charismatic. Many Cubans from Miami's Latin community, felt that the player embodied their own struggles.
Miguel Garay, 78, a Miamian who came from Cuba's Pinar del Rio said: ""His story was our story.
""There's such a great tradition of baseball in Cuba and he embodied it better than anyone.""
After undergoing surgery in 2014 for a torn elbow ligament Fernandez became a US citizen in 2015, where he gave the keynote speech at his citizenship ceremony.
He said: ""This is one of my important accomplishments. I'm an American citizen now - I'm one of them. I consider myself now to be free.""
Fernandez was described as an ""avid fisherman"" and was aboard a friend's boat when the vessel hit a jetty, causing it to capsize.
He had revealed recently that his girlfriend was pregnant.

xsumfaith,xsum,33794974,"Myra Forde's ex-lawyer says she did not state that the late PM was a client, nor did she threaten to expose him if a prosecution against her was continued.
Forde says she has ""no knowledge of any misconduct on his part"" and recent media coverage had caused her distress.
The UK's historical child sex abuse inquiry is to examine claims about Sir Edward if ""the facts justify it"".
The Metropolitan, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Jersey and Kent forces are conducting separate inquiries into the late MP.
The BBC understands Wiltshire Police halted an inquiry into Forde in the 1990s.
On Monday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would look at whether a case was dropped by Wiltshire Police when a person involved made claims against Sir Edward.
Forde was later convicted of controlling prostitutes after a successful prosecution by the same force.
She was jailed for six years after a trial that included allegations that she had supplied children as young as 13 to her clients.
Fourteen years later Forde was prosecuted and jailed again for inciting prostitution.
Richard Griffiths, Forde's solicitor in 1992, has now spoken on her behalf to the Salisbury Journal.
He told the newspaper: ""My former client wishes me to make it very clear that at no stage did she state that Ted Heath was a client and at no stage did she threaten to expose him as a client of hers if the prosecution was continued.
""For the avoidance of any doubt, Myra Forde wishes me to make it clear that she had no involvement with Ted Heath of any kind and has no knowledge of any misconduct on his part.""
He also said that, at the time of that case, the prosecution ""took what, at the time, seemed a sensible decision that they could not prove their case and offered no evidence"".
Historical child abuse: Key investigations
A spokesman for the UK's ongoing independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard, said that although the allegations about Sir Edward fell within its terms of reference, it had not received any direct allegations.
Sir Edward, who was Conservative prime minister from 1970 to 1974, died aged 89 in 2005  at his home in Salisbury.
Wiltshire Police has declined to comment on the claims that it did not follow up accusations against him during his lifetime, but has appealed for information regarding allegations against Sir Edward.
Meanwhile, Labour MP Tom Watson said he had referred two allegations of child sexual abuse by Sir Edward to the police since 2012, with police confirming that at least one of those allegations was being investigated.
Friends of Sir Edward have dismissed the claims, saying there is not a shred of evidence to link him to abuse.

Both players broke serve twice in the opening four games of a thrilling third set, which Del Potro won in a tie-break, before taking the fourth set to wrap up victory.

Australia's Nick Kyrgios is also in the same half of the draw as Murray and remains on course to meet the world number two in the last 16.
The number 15 seed came from two sets to one down to beat Germany's Dustin Brown 6-7 (3-7) 6-1 2-6 6-4 6-4 in a thrilling, rain-affected second-round match on Court Two.
The pair had only played three points before a rain delay of more than three hours with the German, ranked 85th in the world, then clinching the first set on a tie-break.
Kyrgios swept through the second set in just 15 minutes but Brown regained the advantage by taking the third.
However, the Australian then won the fourth to move level and, after another rain delay, clinched the fifth set to reach round three.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in ""secret"".
It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella.
The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed.
Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was ""another of these secret trials"".
He said: ""Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.""
Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.
He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome ""might come today, it might come next week"".
There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added.
Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was ""more fight in her"" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.
He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was ""unpredictable"" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.
Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""I have watched her grow up on Skype.
""She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English.
""Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.""

The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header.
James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton.

Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go.

The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade.
At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion.
Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6.
It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag.
The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint.
Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place.
Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier.
Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position.
Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres.
Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap.
Vettel said: ""The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.
""I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.""
Button said: ""It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end.
""When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push.
""It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.
""But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.""

xsumfaith,xsum,29237469,"It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud.
The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented.
However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice.
One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option.
The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before.
They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app.
If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase.
They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out.
While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service.
That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker.
Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's ""forensic"" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad.
ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was ""the only one able to do that"".
He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used.
""I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,"" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account.
""The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled.""
However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system.
""The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,"" he said.

xsumfaith,xsum,35278963,"HM Inspectorate of Probation found delays in getting offenders to start their work, and said too many were let off if they did not attend.
In one case, an offender had completed just 16 hours in the 17 months since he had been sentenced.
The Ministry of Justice said it was acting on the report's recommendations.
Anything from 40 to 300 hours of unpaid work - or ""community payback"" - may be given for offences like shoplifting, theft, drug offences, or criminal damage.
Some 70,000 offenders were ordered to do unpaid work such as garden maintenance, decorating or litter-picking in 2014.
Inspectors looked at 100 cases and interviewed 86 offenders from different probation divisions for their report.
The report outlined 15 recommendations for improvement.
Some of the problems identified were:
Seven years ago the government, then led by Gordon Brown, placed an order for 10,000 orange bibs.
They were to be worn by offenders doing unpaid work under a re-branded scheme known as ""community payback"".
It was intended to give the public confidence that community sentences, involving clearing communal paths and gardens, picking up litter and painting over graffiti, were a ""tough"" alternative to imprisonment.
When the coalition came to power in 2010 it promised to make unpaid work more physical and intense, with unemployed offenders required to complete their sentences more quickly.
The difficulty has always been organisation. Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself.
If sanctions are applied, they will end up in prison; if not, the sentence cannot be enforced. As the inspection report reveals, it is a problem the authorities still have not solved.
Inspectors did praise instances of high-quality work, and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment.
They also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and ""were determined to... desist from future offending"".
Among its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that ""match the circumstances of the offender"".
The chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment, which was a ""wasted opportunity"".
""Although we found some high-quality management and delivery, much of it was simply not good enough, lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court.""
He called for ""urgent remedial action"".
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted ""much more effective rehabilitation"" - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not.
""It's totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts.

xsumfaith,xsum,22839609,"Ed Snowden, a 29-year-old former technical worker for the CIA, has since revealed himself to be the source of the leaks in an interview with the Guardian news website.
US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as ""extremely damaging"" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance ""horrifying"".
What could the US government see?
According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals.
The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls.
How much do the spooks know?
Why every call matters
What can you learn from phone records?
According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.
These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches.
All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works.
National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said
Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"".
""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said.
""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.""
What about data-protection laws?
Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.
Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.
Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"".
Are we all being watched?
The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.
""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.
Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"".
Does it make a difference which country you live in?
User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US.
The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.
This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.
""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.
""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.""
Are other governments involved?
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.
It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.
In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities.
""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.
What does this mean for internet use?
William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.
However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"".
""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website.
""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.""
Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.

xsumfaith,xsum,29945991,"In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds.
It is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid.
Back then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge.
They are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four.
If they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.
But not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick.
Part of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault.
Where he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front.
Between them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season.
With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up.
But he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system.
Looking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough.
It is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team.
That means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes.
Doing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight.
In their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games.
They look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault.
When I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield.
Again, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once.
Another problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team.
More than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically.
Sadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem.
Liverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right.
From Mamadou Sakho for ¬£18m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for ¬£20m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer.
They still look all over the place at the back.
Statistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better.
Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected.
What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there.
Simon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box.
Rodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea.
He was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it.
Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home.
Now he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays.
My team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini.
For me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu.
It is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough.
It is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet
He was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season.
Although he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea.
To compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack.
Whether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back.
That way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks.
Going forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed.
The trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli.
He will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy.
Even if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment.
Jose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either.
The only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric.
The Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points.
There is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans.
Whatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished.
He was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future.
Playing in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club.
The older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one.
At 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle.
What he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively.
Because, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that ""his legs have gone"".
Of course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test.
What happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside
But it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation.
As you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone.
There is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't.
I knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them.
What does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself.
I knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer.
For me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players.
Of all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with.
He was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen.
Saturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside.
Of course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him.
It would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does.
It is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too.

The Supreme Court said it will now hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal, and if so, decide if it should be ""allowed or dismissed"".
An interim injunction will remain in place until the end of the hearing.
On Monday, Court of Appeal judges gave the man - who has young children, and whose spouse is also in the public eye - until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to apply to take the case to the UK Supreme Court.
In that ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday.
The Supreme Court said that interim injunction will now remain in place until the conclusion of the next hearing.
The Sun on Sunday wants to publish an account of alleged extra-marital activities by the man, who is referred to as PJS.
But he argues he has a right to privacy and has taken legal action.
Monday's court judgement said the celebrity had ""occasional sexual encounters"" with another person - referred to in court as AB - starting in 2009.
They had a text message exchange in December 2011 in which they discussed a ""three-way"" with AB's partner, CD.
Accordingly, the three met for a three-way sexual encounter.
In January, the two other parties approached the Sun On Sunday with the story.
That month a High Court judge refused to impose an injunction barring publication.
But the man appealed and two appeal court judges ruled in his favour. They prevented him being identified in publications in England and Wales.
Lawyers for News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun On Sunday - then asked Court of Appeal judges to lift the ban.
They argued that stories had been published in the US, Scotland and elsewhere where the injunction does not apply. The story had also spread across the internet and on Twitter.
PJS opposed that application and said the ban should stay.
On Monday, the judges ruled that PJS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction

The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a full explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action.
""Maybe it highlights that there is a gap within the anti-doping code which allows only a two-year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re-test,"" added Minichiello.
""I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be banned for the whole time. Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective.""
Chernova's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June, and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August, she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
""It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them,"" said Minichiello.
""That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked. I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at.""
Last week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences.
Wada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary, with a report due to be published by the end of the year.

They accuse McDonald's of forcing franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees.
McDonald's said it shared risks and rewards with its licencees.
In a statement, McDonald's said: ""We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses.
""This approach, with the principle of sharing risk and reward, has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers.""
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European unions, including the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union in the UK, are supporting the formal antitrust complaint.
""McDonald's abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone: franchisees, consumers, and workers. We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald's accountable,"" said SEIU organising director, Scott Courtney.
The European Commission said it would now study the submission. It has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded.
The consumer organisations claim franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts.
They also said licensees lease premises from the company at above market rates.
It is claimed this leads to poorer consumer choice and higher prices in franchise stores as opposed to those owned directly by the company.

xsumfaith,xsum,29999735,"The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September.
Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects.
The UK detectives will now compile a report and ""update the families of Hannah and David,"" a spokesman said.
""Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible,"" the Met Police said in a statement.
""They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings.
""The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit.""
Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings.
Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions.
The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty.
However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation.
The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment.
The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand.
He had previously rejected offers of assistance.

xsumfaith,xsum,21712349,"It works by looking for a combination of ""markers"" in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease.
Delegates at the Alzheimer's Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics.
It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said.
The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and APOE.
But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease.
Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test.
Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients.
But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising.
""Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's using a blood test.
""As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future.""
He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment.
It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained.
Potentially, it could be a ""cheap and easy pre-screen"" test which enabled Alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said.
""The way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk.
""If they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing.""
Dr Eric Karran, director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy, and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital.
""While there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available, the results are promising.

xsumfaith,xsum,37576654,"On Thursday, an investment manager and hairdresser will challenge the right of the government to start the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU without a vote in Parliament.
Lawyers will question whether Prime Minister Theresa May is entitled to act unilaterally, using powers left over from the days of medieval monarchs.
It could end up - in theory - with Parliament being given a means to stop Brexit.
So as constitutional rows go, it is box office stuff.
Or as professor of public law at Cambridge University, Mark Elliott, puts it: ""I don't rule out the possibility of the government losing the case.""
Leading the fight against the government is Gina Miller, who runs an investment firm in London, SCM Private.
She argues that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law.
She is confident she has a strong case and is undaunted by criticism.
""I do not back away from a fight,"" she says. ""I'm very vocal about things and I'm no stranger to making enemies.""
She is joined by London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.
Also weighing into the case against the government is the group, Fair Deal for Expats.
Around two million British citizens are believed to live and work in other EU countries.
The Brexit terms have not been decided but expats - some of whom were barred from voting in the referendum - fear potential repatriation and are worried about the impact on their jobs and homes as well as the ramifications for healthcare, their children's schooling and pensions.
Three London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - have agreed to take up the case. Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.
Superstar of the bar"" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.
Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.
He said: ""There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.
""We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.""
In political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.
The UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.
The question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?
During the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.
That right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.
The use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.
Over centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.
But government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.
One such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.
The government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is ""entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice"".
Critics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.
They say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.
Lawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.
It would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.
Grahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the ""enforced removal"" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be ""completely unprecedented"" in a modern democracy.
""I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,"" he says.
Lawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.
The chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a ""shock"".
He is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.
He states: ""If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.""
His lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens ""beyond these shores"" are so fundamental that legislation is ""required"" to take them away.
But in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.
The Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.
There will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.
In their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the ""clear understanding"" that the outcome of the referendum would be ""respected"".
If Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to ""give effect to the will and decision of the people"".
Conservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: ""To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.""
But lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an ""advisory"" referendum - not a binding one.
They state: ""Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.""
The biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.
They says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.
Sir Bill Cash said: ""We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.
""That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.""
Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.
Mark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.
""If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.""
Putting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.
Gina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against ""prerogative creep"".
""The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.""
If the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.
The majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.
But would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?
Most members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.
If the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.
It raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.",the government has launched a legal challenge against the government\'s decision to allow the uk to leave the european union.,TConvS2S,val,intrinsic,['intrinsic-NP'],['the government has launched a legal challenge'],['an investment manager and hairdresser will challenge'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there.
""We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him.
""But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there.

""He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team.""
Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson.

Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting.
The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack.
The Taliban has denied any involvement.
More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said.
World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game'
How successful has IS been in Afghanistan?
Stuck between IS and the Taliban
President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"".
""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said.
The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"".
One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us.""
The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital.
Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month.
But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks.
If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months.
In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks.
The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control.
TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building.
More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead.
The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies.
Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"".
IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks.
In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people.
Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30.
IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, told Luton Crown Court he had been blinded by the setting sun.
He accepted he had struck Mrs Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
Mrs Blackburn is now being treated in residential care.
Judge Michael Kay QC paused the case for five minutes so Mr Wright could compose himself after he told the court how he had turned his victim's ""world upside down"".
Mr Wright said: ""I understand Sylvia was a much-loved lollipop lady, who was loved by the children.
""I am truly sorry for what I have done to her and her family.""
Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop for a red light, the jury heard.
The married mother-of-three, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils left school.
When the traffic lights turned red, Mrs Blackburn, who was wearing appropriate clothing, stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road.

xsumfaith,xsum,37565125,"Temperton died in London last week at the age of 66 after ""a brief aggressive battle with cancer"", Jon Platt of Warner/Chappell music publishing said.
Temperton's other hits included Off The Wall and Baby Be Mine for Jackson and Boogie Nights for his band Heatwave.
Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers was among those paying tribute, tweeting: ""Your genius gave us a funkier world!""
Michael Jackson's sister LaToya wrote: ""A brilliant prolific #songwriter Rod Temperton may you #RIP one of my favorite #songs Rock With You #Thriller #legend #Music #MichaelJackson""
Producer and DJ Mark Ronson wrote: ""So devastated to hear that Rod Temperton has passed away. a wonderful man & one of my favourite songwriters ever. thank you for the magic x""
Temperton, whose private funeral has taken place, was nicknamed The Invisible Man because of his low profile.
Born in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, Temperton traced his songwriting ability back to his father's influence.
""My father wasn't the kind of person who would read you a story before you went off to sleep,"" he once said.
""He used to put a transistor radio in the crib and I would go to sleep listening to Radio Luxembourg, and I think somehow that had an influence.""
In the 1970s, after a spell working in a frozen food factory in Grimsby, he answered an advert in Melody Maker magazine for a keyboardist.
The band he joined was disco group Heatwave, and his songs like Boogie Nights, Always & Forever and Groove Line became big hits for the band in the 1970s.
By the time he left the band in 1978, his tunes had caught the attention of producer Quincy Jones, who was looking for songwriters for a new Michael Jackson LP.
Temperton penned three songs for Off The Wall, which became Jackson's breakthrough solo album - the title track, Rock With You and Burn This Disco Out.
He went on to write three more for follow-up Thriller - the title track, which became one of Jackson's signature smashes, plus Baby Be Mine and The Lady in My Life.
They helped make Thriller the best-selling album of all time in the US, with 32 million copies sold.
His tunes have also been recorded by artists including Anita Baker, Donna Summer, Aretha Franklin and The Brothers Johnson.
Temperton won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his work on Birdland, from Quincy Jones's album Back on the Block.
He was nominated for two Oscars in 1986 for his work with Jones on the soundtrack for The Color Purple.
He once summed up his approach to songwriting: ""The first criteria is write something you love first, and once you feel those hairs standing up on the back of your hand, you can go to the world.""
In a statement released on Wednesday, Warner/Chappell's Jon Platt said: ""His family is devastated and request total privacy at this, the saddest of sad times.""
Vocalist Chaka Khan, who recorded Temperton's tracks with the funk band Rufus, paid tribute, writing on Twitter: ""Thank u 4 your superlative songwriting @RodTemperton. U will always Live in Me. Rest in power.""

The group has suggested a fish with the slogan Skegness - A Happy Plaice.
The mayor of Skegness said all suggestions were welcome but said he did not think there would be much support for Jolly to be axed.
The original Jolly Fisherman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness.
The poster featured the slogan ""Skegness is so bracing"".
It was commissioned in 1908 for 12 guineas and has became synonymous with the Lincolnshire resort.
However, Dawn Carr, of Peta, said Jolly ""evokes images of cruelty to animals"".
""Fish being tricked into impaling themselves in the mouth, animals being pulled out of the ocean in giant nets where they are so crushed together the pressure pushes their stomachs out through their mouths and their eyes pop out.""
""This is what the Jolly Fisherman represents,"" she said.
She said Peta's suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination.

xsumfaith,xsum,38450424,"The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.
It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry.
On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction.
The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had ""ironclad information"" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and ""pushed hard"" for its passage.
A US state department spokesman said the accusation was ""just not true"", but he hoped the resolution would ""serve as a wake-up call"" for Israel.
More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.
The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements ""has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace"".
Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.
Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister.
The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot.
But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed.
Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech.
""It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,"" he said.
""We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.""
Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as ""misleading critiques"" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.

In between, Hector Bellerin and Sanchez both failed to hit the target and Mesut Ozil volleyed over the crossbar for Arsenal.
Striker Oumar Niasse had Hull's best chances - his header and low strike forced Petr Cech into sharp saves - while Adama Diomande nodded over late on.

On this occasion, Sanchez did not look like he purposefully pushed the ball into the net and he had little time to move out of the way after the ball came off Jakupovic.
After consultation with his assistant, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal, but prior to that in the first half, Theo Walcott had a shot blocked by the hand of Clucas inside the area, for which no penalty was given.
After the game, Hull defender Andrew Robertson told Sky Sports that Clattenburg had apologised to the Hull players after half-time.
Robertson added: ""The ref told us he didn't give it because he wasn't 100% sure. Not many referees can admit they're wrong, so it's good when he does, though it doesn't make things better.""

Chasing the game in the second half, Hull's Lazar Markovic was running onto a long punt forward deep in the Arsenal half.
The Serb was barged down by Gibbs, who was the last defender, and had the on-loan Liverpool man not been infringed, he would have had a clear run through on goal from 30 yards.
Clattenburg spotted the incident and presented a yellow card.
Gibbs said after the game: ""I took a chance with the challenge on Markovic. The ref said the ball was going away from goal.""
When asked if Gibbs should have been sent off, Hull boss Marco Silva said: ""Yes. It is true. Markovic go to the goal.""
With Hull pushing for an equaliser, they were hit on the counter by the home side. Jakupovic came sprinting off his line as Sanchez went round him and picked out Perez at the back post, but the Spaniard's goal-bound header was kept out by Clucas' arm on the line. Clucas was given a red card for the incident.
Sanchez stepped up to take the penalty, drilling a low finish into the net, which was his seventh goal against Hull in just four games.
It was also his 17th top-flight strike this season, making him the league's leading marksman.

Arsenal had lost back-to-back league games against Watford and Chelsea to leave their title challenge in disarray.
But the win moves them up to third in the table, nine points behind leaders Chelsea.

Despite the defeat, Tigers supporters will be buoyed by the impact made by new manager Silva as his side look well-equipped for a battle to stay in the top-flight, yet they remain in the relegation zone by a single point.
Former Hull defender Peter Swan on BBC Radio Humberside
Hull City's performance was strong, and they did really all they could. The referee's decisions have hurt Hull today, but the side are showing they have got a very real chance of staying up.
For the second goal, you have got to feel sorry for Clucas. His keeper has stitched him right up. It was an easy decision for Clattenburg.
And do you want to know the irony? Jakupovic had probably made up the ground and was covering behind Clucas, not that the defender knew.

xsumfaith,xsum,38898611,"Swansea University's Dr Neil Loader and Emeritus Prof Alayne Street-Perrott, are among a team who have found ancient earthworks, possibly 2,000 years old.
The discoveries were made in Acre state in the western Brazilian Amazon.
Researchers from the universities of Exeter and Reading, and Brazil's S√É¬£o Paulo, Bel√É¬©m are also part of the team.
Their research investigated ditched enclosures which were concealed for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation allowed the discovery of more than 450 large geometrical ""geoglyphs"".
The team said the function of these mysterious sites is still little understood.
They are unlikely to be villages, since archaeologists have recovered very few artefacts during excavation, and their layout does not suggest they were built for defensive reasons.
Instead it is thought they were used only sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America, or Britain's own Stonehenge.
Although Dr Loader - who has analysed soil samples from the geoglyphs - said the surroundings in which they were built were very different to other ritual sites around the world.
He looked at phytoliths - a type of microscopic plant fossil made of silica - to reconstruct ancient vegetation; charcoal quantities, to assess the amount of ancient forest burning; and carbon stable isotopes, to indicate the type of vegetation growing there in the past.
""The indications are that the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation. So, unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America, they were likely not visible above the forest canopy, and this raises questions about their purpose,"" he explained.
It had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century, the Amazonian forests had been pristine ecosystems, free from human influence.
But the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, which could only have been artificially brought together by humans.
It suggested instead of burning large tracts of forest - either for geoglyph construction or agricultural practices - people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms.
The team have likened it to a form of ""prehistoric supermarket"" of useful forest products.
They said there is ""tantalizing evidence"" to suggest the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient ""agroforestry"" practices to this day.","humans lived in the amazon rainforest much earlier than previously thought, and even helped shape its biodiversity, researchers have said.",Gold,val,extrinsic,['extrinsic-predicate'],"['much earlier than previously thought, and even helped']",['people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.
The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.
Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (¬£675,000) to $50,000 (¬£34,000).
Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.
The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.
""I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,"" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.
Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.
The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.
The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.
Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.
""We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,"" said Snoussi.
""But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium.""
""But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. ""We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.
""In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match.""
Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.
""Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,"" said Snoussi.
""We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.""
Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.
Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.","tunisia and morocco\'s differences with the confederation of african football (caf) are in the past, both north african nations say.",Gold,val,intrinsic,['intrinsic-predicate'],['north african nations say'],['FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emotion. Drama. Excitement. Brilliant football. Noise. Colour. And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre.
It was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel.
Liverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic.
Liverpool into last four after Euro thriller
Istanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp
Liverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan
When Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to ""turn doubters into believers"".
And it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened.
In nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration.
Liverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: ""Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try.""
And yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes.
It was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren.
Borussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up.
It takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: ""We decide when it's over.""
This was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do.
If anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left.
This night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop.
Before the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence.
A minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions.
It was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere.
Slowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken.
Klopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night.
Tuchel said: ""When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match.""
Klopp added: ""It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories.""
There was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night.
In the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed.
And yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool.
Divock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge.
Even as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: ""We're going to have a lot of fun with this player.""

Emre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team.
It seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer.
Alberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of ""a win for the Liverpool country"" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals.
One thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield.
Most definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp.
Sevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four.
But there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it.
Klopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals.
The Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view.
The famous ""This Is Anfield"" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund.
It carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: ""I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big.""

Pulido, 25, was abducted at gunpoint on Saturday night in his home town of Ciudad Victoria in Tamaulipas state.
A 38-year-old man has been arrested.
Officials say the man had confessed to belonging to a local criminal gang. Police are searching for another three men believed to have been involved in the kidnapping.
State prosecutor Ismael Quintanilla said the masked gang had taken Pulido to a house in Ciudad Victoria where he eventually found himself alone with one of his abductors.
""They traded blows. He takes it [the phone] and calls [emergency number] 066. It all happened very quickly,"" Mr Quintanilla told Imagen radio.
An official report of the calls Pulido made to the emergency operator, obtained by the Associated Press, revealed that he threatened and beat the kidnapper while on the phone, demanding to be told where they were.
In one of the calls, Pulido said police were outside and starting to shoot so he described what he was wearing to avoid being mistaken for a kidnapper.
Pulido had been abducted when his car was surrounded by several vehicles as he was leaving a party with his girlfriend on Saturday night.
Masked men whisked him away, leaving his girlfriend unharmed.
Pulido's family received a phone call on Sunday demanding a ransom payment, Mr Quintanilla told reporters. No ransom was paid.
Pulido, with one of his hands bandaged, told reporters early on Monday: ""[I am] very well, thank God.""

xsumfaith,xsum,40285994,"The Labour leader has also said he is ""very angry"" that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire.
PM Theresa May said the residents were ""in our thoughts and prayers"" and has ordered a public inquiry into the fire.
But she was criticised by a senior Labour MP for failing to meet residents when she visited the scene on Thursday.
At least 17 people died in the disaster at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London in the early hours of Wednesday.
Mr Corbyn, who earlier released a statement saying he was ""very angry that it was possible for the fire to spread in the way it did,"" said people living in high-rise flats would be frightened following the Grenfell Tower disaster and needed answers to give them ""peace of mind"".
And he told MPs on Thursday: ""The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it's the wealthiest part of the country.
""The ward where this fire took place is, I think the poorest ward in the whole country.
""And properties must be found, requisitioned if necessary, in order to make sure those residents do get re-housed locally.
""It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live.""
Mrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the attack. Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people.
Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited.
Mr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: ""People are angry and I share that anger.""
Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed.
But Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: ""Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV.""
The prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the ""professionalism and bravery"" of the emergency services.
She pledged that the government ""stands ready to provide every assistance"" to the council and emergency services.
""I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home.""
She has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected.
But MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended.
At the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: ""What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy.""
He said the ""exceptionally complex"" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for ""plodding bureaucracy"" in the official response.
""It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,"" he said.
Answers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said.
""Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried.""
Shadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry.
The new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety.
The government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said.
At the end of the meeting, he promised ""every single family"" would be re-housed in the local area.
Earlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, ""to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated"".
Labour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately.
Recommendations made after a fire in a tower block in Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations.
In October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had ""publicly committed"" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire.
Mr Healey said this review had ""not been started"".
""The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,"" he said.
Responding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was ""simply not true"" that a report about building regulations had been ""sat on"".
The BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry.
He or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness.

The threats were made to the Jewish community centres through calls that were both pre-recorded and live, with suspects using voice-disguising technology, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
Since the beginning of the year, there have been reports of threats to centres in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Delaware, Connecticut, Alabama, California, Maine, Tennessee, South Carolina, Missouri, Wisconsin, Texas and Kansas.

""Our view is quite clear - we've got a contract,"" Foxall said.

xsumfaith,xsum,34104114,"A journalist and stock market officials are among those arrested, Xinhua said. It gave no other details.
Chinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets.
The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing.
A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua.
Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts.
The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of ""destabilising the market"".
Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours.
The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said.
The news agency said ""seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II"" were also among the offences.
A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of ""spreading fake information"" about the market slump, the report said.
The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he ""wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications"".
In 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three-year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was reposted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times.
Last year, Qin Zhihui, a blogger, was sentenced to three years in a government crackdown on internet rumours.

xsumfaith,xsum,30453069,"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers.
The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International.
All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups.
The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin.
Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions.
""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook.
Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests.
To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney.
The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware.
On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire.
But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC.
On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.
The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media.
During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.""
Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.
Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.
They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website.
In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.
The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.
Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"".
What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders.
The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine.
In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.
And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.
Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia.

xsumfaith,xsum,22839609,"Ed Snowden, a 29-year-old former technical worker for the CIA, has since revealed himself to be the source of the leaks in an interview with the Guardian news website.
US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as ""extremely damaging"" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance ""horrifying"".
What could the US government see?
According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals.
The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls.
How much do the spooks know?
Why every call matters
What can you learn from phone records?
According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.
These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches.
All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works.
National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said
Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"".
""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said.
""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.""
What about data-protection laws?
Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.
Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.
Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"".
Are we all being watched?
The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.
""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.
Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"".
Does it make a difference which country you live in?
User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US.
The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.
This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.
""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.
""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.""
Are other governments involved?
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.
It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.
In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities.
""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.
What does this mean for internet use?
William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.
However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"".
""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website.
""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.""
Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.

xsumfaith,xsum,24553569,"Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns.
It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects.
The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to ""drive up standards"".
The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved.
The study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level.
The report cites figures that suggest  apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems.
Only 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels.
The report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330.
The report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work.
And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship.
In his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were ""poor"".
The attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said.
""Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society,"" he said.
He said the ""cruel deception"" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop.
The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.
No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.
Sir Peter said: ""Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.
""Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.
""England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs.""
Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: ""Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.
""The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.
""The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved.""
A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.
""Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job.

xsumfaith,xsum,37680168,"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill.
Last year ¬£3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by ¬£1bn by the end of this financial year.
A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved ¬£600m, the regulator said.
It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted.
The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them.
Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.
NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short.
The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be.
And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.
The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime.
NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year.
Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work.
It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted ¬£130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be ¬£76, while another was quoted ¬£70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be ¬£35.

""Retribution will catch up with the true instigators, wherever and whoever they are,"" their resolution said.
Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for ""reprisals against journalists"".
""We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,"" the paper said.
On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed.
The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true.
Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny.
""All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,"" said Natalia Poplevskaya.
Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them ""lies"". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya.
The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that ""retribution"" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April.
""There will be retribution!"" he told the Russian news website RBC. ""Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.""
Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters.
In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.
""We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,"" he wrote, urging dialogue.
Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova.
But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya.

In a statement, McDonald's said: ""We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses.

xsumfaith,xsum,35426361,"Biologists studied a group of Sydney octopuses off Australia's east coast and observed a range of behaviour that may indicate complex social signalling.
Octopuses that stand tall, turn dark and spread their web in a ""Nosferatu pose"" are likely showing aggression.
Conversely, octopuses may display a pale colour after losing a fight or when trying to avoid conflict.
It was previously believed that octopuses were largely solitary creatures. Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators.
But Prof Peter Godfrey-Smith said the unique study, based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology, provided a novel perspective on octopus behaviour.
""[An aggressive] octopus will turn very dark, stand in a way that accentuates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot,"" Prof Godfrey-Smith, who co-authored the report, said.
""Clearly the unusual stance is not a physiological response. It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head.
""The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There's no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object.""
The researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the ""Nosferatu pose"", referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus's web was reminiscent of a vampire's cape.
Octopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays.
The contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual.
""Suppose there's a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour,"" Prof Godfrey-Smith said.
The study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus.
Another cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights.
The unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible.
Prof Godfrey-Smith's co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses.
This included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating.
Watching these long videos was ""much more exhausting than I expected"", Prof Godfrey Smith said.
""Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape.

Mr Luciw's family said retired people should undergo regular driving tests.
Age UK said it was ""vital"" older people could drive for as long as possible.
The family described Mr Luciw, the father of a baby girl, as generous, kind-hearted and a lover of practical jokes.
""He had only just turned 27 and he had his whole life ahead of him,"" said his mum Andrea Shelton.
""He was looking forward to his baby's first crawl. Now he will miss all of her life through no fault of his own.""
""It doesn't feel as if we have lost him - it feels as if he has been taken away from us,"" said Mr Luciw's brother Simon.
""There are so many things that should be put in place so things like this could be avoided. People are driving that shouldn't be on the road.
""The older you get, the more your reactions slow down.
""There needs to be some sort of test introduced, in a car with a driving instructor, so you get a true reflection of how good a driver you are.
""You get a free bus pass once you are in your 60s so people can't say they are going to lose their freedom if they have their licence removed.""
Mrs Shelton said Mr Luciw, a delivery driver, was on a long-distance journey with a colleague Andy Harrington when the crash happened at 02:00 GMT on 12 October near Kegworth, Leicestershire.
Mr Newman's car was heading north on the southbound carriageway.
Mr Harrington, who was driving the Ford Transit, said he had not seen Mr Newman's car until the last second.
""I managed to swerve slightly towards the crash barrier but there was nothing I could do,"" he said. ""You couldn't even blink that fast.
""It lives with me. I still get sleepless nights. It's not something I will ever forget.""
Mr Harrington, who sustained serious injuries in the crash, said retired drivers should have to undergo medical examinations.
""It's up to the government whether they listen to us,"" he said. ""But if that driver hadn't been on the road that morning, Michael would still be here with his daughter.""
Currently drivers over 70 in the UK must fill in a self-assessment form every three years to renew their licences. The form does not include a medical or driving test.
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) which maintains the database of registered drivers said it had no plans to restrict licensing on the basis of age.
""Evidence does not show that older drivers are more likely to cause a serious accident than others,"" it said.
""The rules are clear that all drivers over 70 have to renew their licence every three years and have to tell DVLA about any medical conditions which might affect their driving.
""If we find evidence a driver does not meet the appropriate medical standard we immediately remove their entitlement to drive.""
Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said: ""We know driving often allows older people to have the independence to get out and about, go shopping and attend appointments so it's vital that older people are supported to continue driving safely for as long as possible.""

xsumfaith,xsum,29347895,"He died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months, a statement on his website said.
It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date.
Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement.
The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years.
The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments.
Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.
Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt.
His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London.
He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US.
""Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,"" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said.
""He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director.""
The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: ""I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him.""
Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: ""Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him.
""Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man. He had an amazing capacity to absorb information of all kinds and a really sure sense of how things would be if he really tried to reproduce conditions... a very genial person.""

xsumfaith,xsum,40422011,"The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.
The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.
In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.
Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.
It can take Europe‚Äôs biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today‚Äôs specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.
That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.
The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.
The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.
""Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.
""Here, we‚Äôve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,"" he told BBC News.
Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.
The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the ""revolution"" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.
The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.
Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.
The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.
More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.
There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.
OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.
Equity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a ""truly global company"" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.
""A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,"" said OneWeb CEO Eric B√©ranger.
""And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.""
One aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.
The fear is that space could eventually become unusable.
A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.
Brian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.
""We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,"" he told BBC News.
""We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.""
Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.
Airbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.
""Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,‚Äù said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.

xsumfaith,xsum,34793274,"The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars.
MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board.
Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations.
This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau.
The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems.
The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered.
Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time.
The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it.
The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.
In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane.
Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""

xsumfaith,xsum,13569129,"It was scrapped this week at the eleventh hour when the government removed it from parliament moments before it was due to be voted into law.
Under the proposal, which had already passed a first round of voting, it would have been illegal to share information electronically that could ""destroy, alter or subvert state institutions"" or ""damage national integrity or independence"".
This would have meant anyone criticising the government on social networking sites such as Facebook, or receiving an email containing anti-government sentiment, could have faced up to 12 years in prison.
The law also wanted to ban the online sharing of videos, pictures or recordings without the subject's consent, criminalise ""whistle-blowing"" under the crime of ""espionage"" and make it illegal for anyone to search for information about the state, even if it was not classified.
Minister of State Carlos Feijo told reporters in the capital, Luanda, that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision.
But many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists, who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was ""totalitarian"" and violated basic freedom of expression, played a role in the decision to abandon the law.
US-based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have ""undercut both freedom of expression and information, and posed a severe threat to independent media, whistle-blowers, and investigative journalism"".
With most of Angola's traditional media controlled by the state, or owned by government ministers and their business associates, there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio.
Opposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time, while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin.
Civil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet, even though only 1% of Angolans have access to the web, to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites.
In recent months, several anti-government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook, where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There, people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public.
Angolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online, creating websites to rally support for regime change, and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa, the UK and Belgium.
Many are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country's oil wealth among the majority, two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity.
The introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest.
In an uncharacteristically emotional speech last month, President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites, saying they were being used to ""insult, denigrate and provoke uproar and confusion"".
Officially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography, hacking and online financial fraud.
The editor of the private weekly newspaper Angolense, Suzana Mendes, who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law, welcomed its withdrawal.
""The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important, because if it had been approved, it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed,"" she told the BBC.
Sizaltina Cutaia, from the Angolan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (Osisa), which also opposed the bill, said they were pleased the government had backed down.
""This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across."" she said.
However, civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-poverty demonstration in Luanda.
Organised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Intervention (MRIS), the protest was due to take place at lunchtime.
But following the arrest of MRIS leader Luis Bernardo, allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Cazenga, only a few dozen people gathered in the city square.
According to reports, between 15 and 20 people were detained, among them a journalist and a representative from Osisa who had been trying to film the arrests.
They were later released and rejoined the protest, which at its height numbered around 100 people.
A spokesman for Luanda's provincial government told state media that the youth involved, who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest, had acted ""criminally"" and the police force was within its rights to respond.
""What the government needs to realise is that the more they repress people, the more they will want to demonstrate,"" Ms Cutaia said.
Although small in size and number, protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MPLA.
""The people leading these protests are young and they don't have as much to lose. They were born after independence so they don't have that connection to the ruling party like older generations,"" Ms Cutaia says.
""All they see is that despite Angola's wealth under the MPLA most people have remained poor and they want that to change.

xsumfaith,xsum,16679938,"As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile.
He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex.
There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football.
""I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet,"" he said.
""The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper.
""It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.""
He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict.
Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better.
""You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.""
E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops.
Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe.
""In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,"" he said.
""Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going.
""We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.""
But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale.
""The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,"" he said.
""We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question.
""We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums.
""Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football.
""Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.""
Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau.
""You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,"" he said.
""Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes.
""But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.""
""I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through.
""Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.""
As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry.
The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible.
But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs.
""We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.""
""I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.""
Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones.
""I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,"" he said.
""I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year.

Between the initial fee paid in the summer, signing-on fee, wages during his five-year deal, agents fees and this latest tax payment, Neymar will have cost the club ¬£106.8m
Last month, Sandro Rosell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations he misappropriated money.
He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing.
At the time of the move, Barcelona said they had paid 57m euros (¬£48.6m) for Neymar but it has been alleged that, if other contracts are taken into account, the actual cost of the player was far greater.
And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer.
The club added: ""The board denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player.
""Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros [...] although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations.""
There has not yet been any confirmation whether the case will be dropped after Barcelona's payment.

The Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.
The firm was ""broadly compliant"" with fire safety law, the fire service said.
Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision.
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.
Geoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: ""The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time.""
The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment.
""The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators,"" Mr Harris said.
An EA spokesman said: ""After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit.

xsumfaith,xsum,37278170,"Women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise - but are less likely to get one, the research found.
The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers.
It found ""no support"" for the ""reticent female"" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money.
For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females.
When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found.
The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype.
When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications.
The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.
Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.
""The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.""
He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women ""were more straightforward and tell their friends"".
""Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,"" Prof Oswald added.
""It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.""
The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change.
Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: ""The study potentially has an upside.

xsumfaith,xsum,26952321,"This is the full statement to the inquests from his niece, Ms Natalie Tennant, on behalf of his brother, Peter Copoc:
Stephen Paul Copoc was born on 1 August 1968, and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough.
Stephen was the baby of our family, and the apple of our Mum's eye. Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old.
Our Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house.
Stephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons.
Profiles of all those who died
Stephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day.
When we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way.
I started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one.
As Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it.
He was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys.
He used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him.
However, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying.
When she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt.
Angela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow.
Stephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing.
We had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there.
He seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water.
We think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors.
He finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature.
He applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill.
He loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens.
When Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died.
Stephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation.
He was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money.
He was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours.
He could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him.
Stephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989.
After 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again.
Stephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally.
Stephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends.
Our parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys.
Our Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card.
We miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day.

It's an accusation often made against the star.
How can such a rich man claim to speak up for the poor?
Viewers of Brand's vlogs - The Trews - are familiar with the inside of his spacious London home. It looks lovely and airy. It has wooden floors and exposed brickwork.
When the St Trinian's star was outside the prime minister's Downing Street home - supporting a campaign by residents of an east London estate who fear they will be turfed out of their homes to allow richer renters to move in - Brand was asked about his own accommodation by a TV reporter.
""Part of the problem is the super-rich buying property in London, isn't it? What kind of rent are you paying?""
Brand wasn't very happy with the question. He called the Channel 4 News journalist ""a snide"", before walking off.
Newsbeat contacted Brand to see if he was really going to take legal action against The Sun and its owner Rupert Murdoch.
He didn't reply, though he has been tweeting about The Sun and it's accusations of hypocrisy - using the hashtag #TheSunLogic.
The star's been condemned as a hypocrite plenty of times before. Here's how he's explained it in the past.
""Don't think I'm unaware of the inevitability of such a charge. I know, I know. I'm rich, I'm famous, I have money... There is no doubt that I as much as anyone have to change.
""Revolution is change. I believe in change, personal change most of all. Know, too that I have seen what fame and fortune have to offer and I know it's not the answer.
""Of course I have to change as an individual and part of that will be sharing wealth, though without systemic change, that will be a sweet, futile gesture.""
""I can't deny that I've done a lot of daft things while I was under the capitalist fugue, some silly telly, soppy scandals, movies better left unmade.
""It's easy to attack me, I'm a right twerp, I'm a junkie and a cheeky monkey, I accept it, but that doesn't detract from the incontrovertible fact that we are living in a time of huge economic disparity and confronting ecological disaster.""
""Now I'm rich and I complain about inequality they say I'm a hypocrite. I'm beginning to think they just don't want inequality on the agenda because it is a real problem that needs to be addressed.""

Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure, saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805, home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke's Drift.
""This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way,"" he said.
""The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town.
""Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century.
""This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history.""
Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision, saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales.
He also hoped the closure would not damage the town's ""thriving"" military tourism industry.
Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk.
Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected.
Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan.
Cawdor Barracks, Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024, while a storage depot at Sennybridge will go in 2025.
Responding for Labour, Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, MP for Llanelli, said the ministry was ""right to restructure its estate"".

The freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay have been operated by Seatruck, which is contracted to run the service by Serco Northlink.
Seatruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents.
Serco Northlink said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined to accept.
Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised.

He called for more international financial support to help build schools and train teachers.
""The alternatives are very bad,"" said Mr Thneibat.
""The international community will pay a high price if we don't stand together to face this serious problem,"" he told the Global Education and Skills Forum.
Mr Thneibat said Jordan already had Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and now had 1.3 million Syrians who had fled across its borders.
""We're trying to do everything to educate these young people for peace, introducing ideas of tolerance and co-existence,"" Mr Thneibat, who is also Jordan's education minister, told the international conference in Dubai.
But he warned that Syria's neighbours did not have the capacity to deal with such an influx of families without more international assistance.
He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools, which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 145,000 refugee children in its state school system.
But there were still more children arriving than could be taught, he warned.
There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged, Mr Thneibat said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan's own education budget, he said.
This was in addition to extra costs in health, housing and infrastructure.
Without any access to education, he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict.
""If we leave these students, we believe they could become extremists.""
Tom Fletcher, UK ambassador to Lebanon until last year, said the numbers of refugees were now ""staggering"".
Mr Fletcher is now working for a coalition trying to get business support to tackle the refugee crisis.

xsumfaith,xsum,38048733,"The president-elect has said Mrs Trump and Barron will move to Washington ""very soon, after he's finished with school"", but has not put an actual date on the move.
But transition spokesman Jason Miller's insistence that the Trumps were ""energised and excited about their new role serving the country"" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media.
""First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world,"" wrote one Twitter user, Pamela Benbow. ""Melania Trump's decision is appalling.""
Others joked it was Mrs Trump's taste in interiors which had prompted the decision, while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps' marriage.
However, the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising. There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence.
But Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters.
""Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age,"" one Twitter user noted.
However, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers.
But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before?
William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season.
The president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as ""Oak View"" but it was more commonly known as ""Red Top"" because of its red roof.
But the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House.
""The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,"" Mr Seale said.
""It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising.""
Mr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House.
James Madison's wife, Dolley Madison, also sent her son from her first marriage, Payne Todd, away to school.
There have been two sets of school age children living in the White House in the past three decades: Chelsea Clinton, who was 12 at the time, and Malia and Sasha Obama, who were 10 and seven respectively.
They also had to move across the country when their fathers became president - but all three lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from the day of the inauguration.
In fact, the Obamas avoided the problem of the girls having to change school mid-term by moving to Washington early, allowing them to start a new school a few weeks before Dad was inaugurated in January 2009.
Read more: Why Obama may not go quietly
Mrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, with everything else coming second. Reading between the lines, it suggests she will not be taking on the full-time role predecessors like Mrs Obama have.
Officially, the role of the first lady is only ceremonial - she is supposed to be the White House's hostess, organising and attending functions with or without their spouses.
In more recent times, they have also sought out causes to support and promote. Mrs Obama has used her time backing a number of initiatives and projects, including Let Girls Learn, that aims to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school.
The first lady occupies a very public role, according to Mr Seale.
""It gives a kind of personal side to the White House. It might even be considered vital to the public's perception of the president,"" he said. ""[The president] is an administrator and a he is a symbol and I think the first lady's role is very important to that symbol part.""
Lou Henry Hoover, wife to President Herbert Hoover, was the first president's wife to really take on an active public role, Mr Seale said.
Her immediate successor, Eleanor Roosevelt, also served as a more visible first lady in her husband's administration.
One notable first lady who was reluctant to step into the public role was Nancy Reagan, according to Mr Seale.
Mrs Reagan, who had a big influence on her husband's presidency and would later become known for her anti-drug campaign, was at first only focused on being a supportive wife.
""Her big interest in the world was her husband,"" Mr Seale said, adding that she was a very private person.
As to what Melania's priorities will be there is only one hint - she is interested in tackling cyber-bullying.
Read more: Taking to the streets for women's issues
It has happened in the past. However, not when the president's wife has still been alive.
Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph took the role in 1801, while Angelica van Buren took up the duties of a first lady after marrying President Martin van Buren's son in 1838. Both men had lost their wives almost 20 years earlier.
However, could Ivanka Trump - described as her father's ""proxy wife"" by Vanity Fair during the election campaign - take up some of the responsibility from her step-mother?
There is more recent precedent, too. Chelsea performed some of her mother's duties during the final days of her father's presidency, while Mrs Clinton concentrated on her own political career.
The White House can be whatever the family makes it.
Chelsea was known to do her homework in the Oval Office from time to time, while she also hosted sleepovers for friends - which could mean they found themselves sitting with the President the next morning, as Bill Clinton always tried to have breakfast with his daughter.
Both Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama fit their duties as First Lady around their children, and both families asked for the press to respect their daughters' privacy - requests which were, on the whole, respected.
The Obamas are also strict about putting time aside for the girls: family dinner takes place every night at 18:30. Mr Obama has said only a national emergency will stop him joining his family.
""The surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more 'normal' than it's ever been,"" the President said in an interview with US magazine More earlier this year.
It is a response echoed by Chelsea about her own years.
She told the Huffington Post: ""I was always deeply aware that I was living in history. But then I would have dinner with my parents at the kitchen table every night. There was so much about my life that also was normal.""",melania trump has said he is ``excited\'\'about the decision to leave the white house in the white house.,PtGen,val,intrinsic,['intrinsic-predicate'],"['january', 'the revelation that melania and barron trump would not be joining donald in the white house in january has raised eyebrows in some quarters, and garnered praise in others']","['president-elect', 'move to Washington', 'move into the White House']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xsumfaith,xsum,32219005,"Ashya was being treated in hospital in Southampton when his parents took him abroad without telling staff last year.
They ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy.
It was later revealed Ashya did not receive subsequent chemotherapy in Prague, a move the team in Southampton say could jeopardise his recovery.
Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Dr Peter Wilson, paediatric intensive care consultant at Southampton General Hospital, said: ""We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is... every month that goes by that he's not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens.
""There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival - so survival going from 80% to 40% or 50%, which is quite dramatic.""
The Kings' version of events last year sparked a public outcry and staff members in Southampton said they received angry emails, letters and phone calls which, at one stage, forced the hospital to shut its switchboard.
The King family, who in March said five-year-old Ashya was now cancer free, declined to be interviewed as part of the BBC programme.
In March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed ""no evidence"" of the tumour.
But cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured.
Oncology specialist Professor Karol Sikora said: ""Ashya is not completely out of the woods yet, but 78% of children with this type of rare cancer actually survive and are cured.
""The fact he is disease free at this point is great, but it doesn't mean he is cured yet.""
The breakdown in the relationship between Brett King and the hospital stemmed from his belief that Ashya should not receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy following surgery to remove a brain tumour.
Mr King claimed in a YouTube video that staff threatened him with a court order if he refused Ashya's treatment, something the hospital has denied.
He told journalists in Spain after his arrest: ""They were going to kill him in England or turn him into a vegetable.""
Through the media, the King family raised tens of thousands of pounds for Ashya's treatment before the NHS agreed to pay for proton therapy in Prague.
Dr Nicky Thorp, of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group of paediatricians, said: ""We were dismayed, but on reflection I can see why NHS England agreed to fund that child's case. The child was there, the child needed radiotherapy.
""The use of protons does not improve cure rates of tumours... and it saddens me to see the way the truth can be twisted and misunderstood.""
In Prague, Ashya's parents refused the chemotherapy, which had been recommended by doctors and ordered by the High Court.
But in March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Mr King said his son was cancer free.
Paediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, who was involved in Ashya's treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent.
She said: ""I don't think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child's treatment.""
Dr Wilson said the case had led to an ""impossible situation"" for clinicians faced with families in the same situation.
""That is deeply unfair when the NHS is always supposed to be about equal healthcare for all,"" he added.

The American, 32, looked set to take part after warming up on the range but he then withdrew on the first tee.
The US Open champion fell on the stairs and hurt his lower back on Wednesday.
""I'm playing the best golf of my life and to have a freak accident happen yesterday afternoon, it sucks really bad,"" said Johnson.
""I have been worked on all morning and obviously I can take some swings, but I can't swing full, I can't make my normal swing and I didn't think there was any chance I could compete.""
The 15-time PGA Tour winner added: ""I was wearing socks and slipped and went down the three stairs. The left side of my lower back took the brunt of it and my left elbow is bruised as well.""
Johnson's caddie was placing the ball on his tee for him on the range, while coach Butch Harmon said pain hindered Johnson's rest overnight.
Shortly before his withdrawal, he progressed from hitting wedge shots on the range to fuller swings and his involvement looked likely as he made his way to the first tee for a scheduled 19:03 BST start alongside playing partners Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker.
Johnson was a popular pick to win the first major of the year as a result of the fine form he has shown in 2017. He has won the past three tournaments in which he has competed - February's Genesis Open, and both the WGC Mexico Championship and WGC Dell Match Play in March.
As well as winning last year's US Open by four shots, he finished ninth at the Open Championship and tied fourth at the Masters.

xsumfaith,xsum,33960105,"They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber.
Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood.
Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation.
Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow.
But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs.
Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies.
As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than √Ç¬£450m a year to the Welsh economy.
But there is a conflict with environmental policy.
Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife.
However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents.
The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed.
It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland.
It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"".
Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry.
He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas.
Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers.
""There's a huge market for our timber.

Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.
A service was also held at Westminster Abbey.
The national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung as the service ended.
The first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was when King George V attended a Westminster Abbey service in 1916, a year after the Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landings at Gallipoli.
Since then, the services have become an important moment for thousands of expatriate and visiting New Zealanders and Australians, who honour the sacrifices of their countrymen and women in all wars.
Addressing the crowds at the dawn service, Alexander Downer, Australian high commissioner to the UK, who also laid a wreath, said: ""When we reflect on Anzac Day we imagine the Gallipoli landings, what it must have been like, at dawn on the water, in sight of that rugged shoreline - and a collectively held breath, a leaden silence about to be broken.
""We consider the enthusiasm, the courage, and the heroism of the Anzac troops - ordinary men fighting for God, King and empire, for their mates, for adventure, for a world without war.""
Members of veterans' associations, service and ex-service personal and their families took part in the parade at the Cenotaph.

The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding.

Leeds, who slip to third from bottom with just one win from their first six league fixtures, rarely threatened.
Town held on to go four points clear thanks to a fifth win from six.
On-loan Manchester City midfielder Mooy was not certain to play after a hectic international break which saw him appear in both of Australia's World Cup qualifiers.
But he dictated the play as the Terriers had the better of a dull first half in which neither side could muster a shot on target.
Mooy, who was booked late in the first period for a nasty-looking lunge that infuriated Leeds manager Garry Monk and his coaching staff, came closest with a decent low strike.
But his second attempt on goal 10 minutes after the restart proved much more successful and was reward for the visitors' urgency and superior quality.
Chris Wood sent a header wide for Leeds before the break and could have snatched a barely deserved point late on, but failed to properly connect with another headed opportunity.
Leeds head coach Gary Monk:
""I'm disappointed with the result, of course. We went out there with the intention of trying to grab the initiative but partly due to the way (Huddersfield) set up it became a bit of a nothing game.
""We have to get a real reaction now on Tuesday. We need to take the three points, it's as simple as that.

xsumfaith,xsum,36892561,"Ms Evans, who is currently suspended from UKIP, said she would ""very much like"" to run but a ""handful of people at the top"" had ensured she could not.
Ms Evans' six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand.
She said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage.
Ms Evans said UKIP needed to ""break free of its hard-right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-ground"" and also conduct some ""internal reform"".
The leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"".
In a statement in Westminster, Ms Evans, who had been touted as a possible successor, said: ""I'd very much like to run in that election.
""Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who, for whatever personal reasons of their own, have made quite sure I can't.""
She claimed the party rulebook had been ""abused"" to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May's London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest.
Her six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority.
Ms Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision.
In the statement, she said: ""I have to face up to reality, there's no way they're going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper... I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP.""
Ms Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that ""allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this"", but she said the support from members had made her ""more determined ever not to give up on UKIP"".
She also said that with the right leader, the ""sky was the limit for the party"".
Endorsing Lisa Duffy, a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, Ms Evans said she was ""the best chance"" UKIP had to ""change, to grow and to thrive"".
She said UKIP needed ""a clean break from the past"" to become more like a political party than ""just a rugby club on tour"".
Under Ms Duffy's leadership, she argued, the party would be ""more united and consensual"".
Prior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP's 2015 general election manifesto. She was axed from her policy role in the party in-fighting which followed Mr Farage's ""unresignation"" after the general election.

xsumfaith,xsum,32219005,"Ashya was being treated in hospital in Southampton when his parents took him abroad without telling staff last year.
They ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy.
It was later revealed Ashya did not receive subsequent chemotherapy in Prague, a move the team in Southampton say could jeopardise his recovery.
Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Dr Peter Wilson, paediatric intensive care consultant at Southampton General Hospital, said: ""We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is... every month that goes by that he's not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens.
""There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival - so survival going from 80% to 40% or 50%, which is quite dramatic.""
The Kings' version of events last year sparked a public outcry and staff members in Southampton said they received angry emails, letters and phone calls which, at one stage, forced the hospital to shut its switchboard.
The King family, who in March said five-year-old Ashya was now cancer free, declined to be interviewed as part of the BBC programme.
In March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed ""no evidence"" of the tumour.
But cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured.
Oncology specialist Professor Karol Sikora said: ""Ashya is not completely out of the woods yet, but 78% of children with this type of rare cancer actually survive and are cured.
""The fact he is disease free at this point is great, but it doesn't mean he is cured yet.""
The breakdown in the relationship between Brett King and the hospital stemmed from his belief that Ashya should not receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy following surgery to remove a brain tumour.
Mr King claimed in a YouTube video that staff threatened him with a court order if he refused Ashya's treatment, something the hospital has denied.
He told journalists in Spain after his arrest: ""They were going to kill him in England or turn him into a vegetable.""
Through the media, the King family raised tens of thousands of pounds for Ashya's treatment before the NHS agreed to pay for proton therapy in Prague.
Dr Nicky Thorp, of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group of paediatricians, said: ""We were dismayed, but on reflection I can see why NHS England agreed to fund that child's case. The child was there, the child needed radiotherapy.
""The use of protons does not improve cure rates of tumours... and it saddens me to see the way the truth can be twisted and misunderstood.""
In Prague, Ashya's parents refused the chemotherapy, which had been recommended by doctors and ordered by the High Court.
But in March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Mr King said his son was cancer free.
Paediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, who was involved in Ashya's treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent.
She said: ""I don't think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child's treatment.""
Dr Wilson said the case had led to an ""impossible situation"" for clinicians faced with families in the same situation.
""That is deeply unfair when the NHS is always supposed to be about equal healthcare for all,"" he added.
