The move follows a decision by the UK government to disband the OFT. Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Ã‚Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work.

However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached. James Munro from Powys council, who will lead the new team, has said he hopes it will show Powys could take on more contracts and outside work in future. He spoke to Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales' Peter Johnson about what the new role will involve.\nsumm:Powys council has taken on the role of the former Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for estate agents in Powys. error_type: correct I'm sorry for the confusion, but the summary is not entirely correct.
