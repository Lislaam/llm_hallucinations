Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. \"We welcome it, we are ready for it,\" he said. \"We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.\" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. \"A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people\". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. \"We had an agreement with the crown prince,\" he said. \"The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was \"hopeful\" that he would \"do more than his predecessor\", Hillary Clinton. \"US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.\" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. \"If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. \"It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. \"So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.\" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for \"peaceful demonstrations\", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. \"It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.\" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture.

That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\". \"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. \"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already. \"Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. \"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. \"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to Â£159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than Â£70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising Â£5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at Â£4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. \"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. \"That seems fairer to me,\" he added. The think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's Â£8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing Â£19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.\nsumm:Prime Minister David Cameron has said councils should be allowed to sell off social housing in the most expensive areas of the UK to raise money to build more affordable homes.[/INST] error_type: correct</s>",

Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\". \"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. \"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already. \"Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. \"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. \"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to Â£159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than Â£70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising Â£5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at Â£4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. \"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. \"That seems fairer to me,\" he added. The think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's Â£8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing Â£19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.\nsumm:Prime Minister David Cameron has said councils should be allowed to sell off social housing in the most expensive areas of the UK to raise money to build more affordable homes. error_type: correct Based on the provided text, the summary is correct as it accurately reflects the main point of the article, which is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said councils should be allowed to sell off social housing in the most expensive areas of the UK to raise money to build more affordable homes.

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming Â£2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting Â£1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of Â£11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to Â£260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. \"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than Â£2.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants.
